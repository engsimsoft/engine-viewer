<h2><u>Wave Pressure Trace Output (*.wve)</u></h2>

<p><span lang="EN-UK" style="font-size:12.0pt">The wave pressure trace files are part of
the new or over written files. They have the project name appended with the rpm value and
the extension <b>.wve</b>. The pressure traces for project Honda at 8000 rpm will be in the file:
<b>Honda8000.wve</b>. This file will be in the project directory and over written each time a
simulation at its specific rpm is conducted.</p>

<p>It has the following traces as output: 

<ul>
  <li><strong>Deg</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    -&nbsp;
    Engine degrees using the last cylinder as reference.</li>
  <li><strong>PinLeft</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Pressure trace of the left
    moving (away from the cylinder) pressure wave at the trace position in each inlet
    pipe.</li>
  <li><strong>PinRight</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;Pressure trace of the right
    moving (towards the cylinder) pressure wave at the trace position in each inlet
    pipe.</li>
  <li><strong>PipLeft</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Pressure trace of the left
    moving (away from the cylinder) pressure wave at the inlet valve per cylinder.</li>
  <li><strong>PipRight</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;Pressure trace of the right
    moving (towards the cylinder) pressure wave at the inlet valve per cylinder.</li>
  <li><strong>PepLeft</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Pressure trace of the left
    moving (towards the cylinder) pressure wave at the exhaust valve per cylinder.</li>
  <li><strong>PepRight</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Pressure trace of the right &nbsp;
    moving (away from the cylinder) pressure wave at the exhaust valve per cylinder.</li>
  <li><strong>PexLeft</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Pressure trace of the left
    moving (towards the cylinder) pressure wave at the trace position in each
    exhaust pipe.</li>
  <li><strong>PexRight</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Pressure trace of the right &nbsp;
    moving (away from the cylinder) pressure wave at the trace position in each
    exhaust pipe.</li>
</ul>

<p>The wave pressure traces are not pressure values but pressure ratios, they are the
absolute pressure of the left or right moving pressure waves divided by the
atmospheric
pressure the simulation was conducted at.</p>
