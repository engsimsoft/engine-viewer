<p>The first choice is whether to display the graphs on the intake side or 
exhaust side of the engine.</p>

<p>Selecting the intake side the pressure traces for the final cylinder inlet
port at the crankcase interface, the transfer port at the cylinder interface and
crankcase are displayed. If the engine has a reedvalve a further graph showing
the reed petal tip lift (divided by 10) is also displayed.</p>

<p>Selecting the exhaust side the pressure traces for the exhaust port at the
cylinder interface, the transfer port at the cylinder interface and the cylinder
pressure is shown. Because the cylinder pressure is much higher and will
dominate the display the graph is limited to a pressure ratio of 3.</p>

<p><span lang="EN-UK" style="font-size:12.0pt">For a single cylinder engine this
is the only option while on multi cylinder engines more options are displayed. After choosing the graphics options a
summary of the port timing and the effective  </span>
