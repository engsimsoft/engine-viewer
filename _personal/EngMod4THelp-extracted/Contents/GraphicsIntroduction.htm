<h2><u>Graphics Introduction</u></h2>

<p><span lang="EN-UK" style="font-size:12.0pt">If the choice from the main menu is made to
display the graphics the following three possibilities exist: 

<ol>
  <li>Single cylinder engine graphics</li>
  <li>2 to 4 cylinder engine graphics</li>
  <li>5 to 8 cylinder engine graphics.</li>
</ol>

<p>The difference between these are the display options. A maximum of four individual
plots per screen is practical so for more than 4 cylinders it is necessary to have a
choice of which group to display. Each is discussed under its own heading.</p>

<p><span lang="EN-UK" style="font-size:12.0pt">After choosing the graphics options a
summary of the cam timing and the effective valve areas are displayed. The next figure
shows this output.</span></p>
