<p>It is also possible to select running the
program from the screen. More than one rpm point can be selected. Typically the following
choices are made for screen runs:</p>

                  <img border="0" src="../Pictures/StartGraphicsPause.jpg"></p>

<p align="left">The next selection is whether to input data from the 
screen or to use the project files for timing and air/fuel ratio:</p>

<p align="left">Selecting the "Manually Input Timing and AFR data" radio button 
opens the following edit boxes:</p>

<p align="left">It is also possible to select more than 1 but no more than 10 
rpm values:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/ScreenDialog4.jpg"></p>

<p align="left">The rpm values for all points can be the same but with different 
ignition timing and/or air fuel ratios to determine for instance the optimum 
timing at a point. The results are in the following file: "ProjectName.spo" and 
it is in the project folder (Usually: "C:\4Stroke\ProjectName\") and can be opened 
with any text editor. It is in ASCII format. Set the editor to "No Wrap" to keep all 
the data for a rpm point in a single line.</p>

<p>The following picture shows an example using "Wordpad" which is a free text editor 
that is supplied with MS/Windows.</p>

<p>Note that the runs are just appended as they complete and there is no indication of 
what they were. The file is used developing the simulation model before full rpm range 
simulations in "Batch-mode" are run. It is up to the operator to keep track of what each 
run is.</p>
