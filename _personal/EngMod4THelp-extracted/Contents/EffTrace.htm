<h2><u>Efficiency Trace Output (*.eff)</u></h2>

<p>The efficiency trace files are part of the new
or over written files. They have the project name appended with the rpm value and the
extension .eff. The efficiency traces for project Honda at 8000 rpm will be in the file: <b>Honda8000.eff</b>.
This file will be in the project directory and over written each time a simulation at its
specific rpm is conducted.</p>

<p>It has the following traces as output: 

<ul>
  <li><b>Deg&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Engine degrees using the last cylinder as reference.</li>
  <li><b>DRatio</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delivery ratio trace at
    the inlet port per cylinder.</li>
  <li><b>PurCyl</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purity trace in the
    cylinder per cylinder.</li>
  <li><b>Seff</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Scavenging efficiency trace per cylinder where the scavening period is defined 
	as the overlap period.</li>
  <li><b>Teff</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Trapping efficiency trace per cylinder.</li>
  <li><b>Ceff</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Charging efficiency trace per cylinder.</li>
</ul>

<p>The purity traces has a value of 1 for pure air and a value of 0 for pure exhaust gas.
Any mixture of the two will have a value between 0 and 1. The efficiencies and
delivery ratio can exceed 1.</p>
