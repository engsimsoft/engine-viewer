<p><span lang="EN-UK" style="font-size:12.0pt">The purity trace files are part of the new
or over written files. They have the project name appended with the rpm value and the
extension <b>.pur</b>. The purity traces for project Honda at 8000 rpm will be in the file: <strong>Honda8000.pur</strong>.
This file will be in the project directory and over written each time a simulation at its
specific rpm is conducted.</p>

<p>It has the following traces as output: 

<ul>
  <li><strong>Deg&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Engine degrees using the last cylinder as reference.</li>
  <li><strong>PurIn&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purity trace at
    the inlet valve per cylinder.</li>
  <li><strong>PurCyl</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purity trace in the
    cylinder per cylinder.</li>
  <li><strong>PurEx</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purity trace at the
