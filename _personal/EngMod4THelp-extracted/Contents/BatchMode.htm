<h2><u>Batch Mode</u></h2>

<p>One of the ways the program can be used is
to calculate a power curve in the 'batch' mode. In this mode the program is started and
continues through all the prescribed rpm points until they are all processed. This mode is
selected by choosing to run the program in the batch mode on the main dialog. This mode
is used to create power curves, torque curves etc. for the engine and individual
cylinders. The performance values are stored in the *.pou file. To select the 
batch mode the user selects the &quot;<b>Batch 
Run</b>&quot; radio button.</p>

<p>By default the choice is made to not display the graphics and to not &quot;beep&quot; 
after each rpm run. The rpm output overwrites the previous batch run files by 
default unless the &quot;<b>Output data to a new File? - Yes</b>&quot; radio button is 
selected after which a text input box opens for the user to give the new name. The name 
"PowerCurve" was used here.</p>

<p>To distinguish a batch run from the others the user has to enter a
descriptive name next. In the example shown the descriptor <b>LongExhaust</b>
was used.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p align="left">Next the user has to specify whether the rpm values are to be
generated or read from a file. Generating results in a constant RPM increment
while in the file varying increments can be used. This example shows the choice of reading it from a
file. After pressing &quot;<b>Continue</b>&quot; the batch run starts and displays a screen similar to
the following:</p>

<p align="left">Before this mode can be selected it is necessary to create a text file
with the same name as the project, the extension <b> *.txt</b> and with a list of the rpm points in it. The following
is an example of such a file:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/BatchRPMFile.jpg" width="262" height="272"></p>

<p align="left">This file is created using a text file utility like Notepad. It can be separately created or from within the 
software by clicking on the "<b>Edit RPM File</b>"-button. It is also possible to create this 
file when running a generated rpm sweep by saving the sweep RPM values as shown in the next dialog. When this
mode is selected only text is displayed in the program window.</p>

<h3 align="left">Batch Run from a Generated RPM Sweep</h3>

<p align="left">The user chooses to generate the RPM sweep from the main dialog.
Next the starting and finishing RPM values are specified followed by the RPM
increment. This is shown in the following picture:</p>

<p align="left">After pressing &quot;<b>Continue</b>&quot; the batch run starts and displays a screen similar to
the following:</p>
