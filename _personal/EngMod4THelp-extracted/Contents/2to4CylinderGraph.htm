<h2><u>2 to 4 Cylinder Graphics</u></h2>

<p><span lang="EN-UK" style="font-size:12.0pt">When choosing to display the 
graphics of a 2 to 4 cylinder engine on the screen further options exist: 

<ol>
  <li>The first option is to display the intake pressure ratio traces for all the cylinders on
    one graph.</li>
  <li>The second option is to display the exhaust pressure ratio traces for all the cylinders
    on one graph.</li>
  <li>The third option displays the intake and exhaust traces similar to the single
    cylinder option. Two further options are available when choosing this option: </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Show individual graphs for all the cylinders</li>
  <li>Choose one cylinder to display.</li>
</ul>
</span>
<p>The final<span lang="EN-UK" style="font-size:12.0pt"> option chooses between
displaying the intake or exhaust side traces.</p>

<p>The following figure shows the choices:</p>

<p align="center">

<p>Selecting the intake side the pressure traces for the final cylinder inlet
port at the crankcase interface, the transfer port at the cylinder interface and
crankcase are displayed. If the engine has a reedvalve a further graph showing
the reed petal tip lift (divided by 10) is also displayed.</p>

<p>Selecting the exhaust side the pressure traces for the exhaust port at the
cylinder interface, the transfer port at the cylinder interface and the cylinder
pressure is shown. Because the cylinder pressure is much higher and will
dominate the display the graph is limited to a pressure ratio of 3.</p>

<p><span lang="EN-UK" style="font-size:12.0pt">After choosing the graphics 
options a summary of the port timing and the effective </span>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt">port</span><span lang="EN-UK" style="font-size:12.0pt"> areas are displayed. The next figure
shows this output.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;A typical output after the required
number of iterations is shown in the next figure:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/Inter3Gr3.gif" width="1024" height="768"></p>

<p>A list of some performance values are displayed at the top of the screen. To continue
to the final screen press &quot;Enter&quot;. The final screen shows a more complete
summary of the performance values as shown in the next figure:</p>
