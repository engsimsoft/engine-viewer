<h1>Types of Exhaust Systems</h1>
<p>There are three main general types of exhaust systems available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Individual pipes per cylinder.</li>
  <li>Ninto1 branch manifolds where N = number of cylinders</li>
  <li>Log manifolds – all cylinders connect to a single pipe.</li>
</ul>

<p>On top of these “normal” pipes there is a range of special pipes available
depending on the engine types.</p>

<p>All the pipes can have one of three types of “collector outlets”:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Plain pipe. A normal plain opening to the atmosphere.</li>
  <li>Box pipe. The system flows into a box or plenum and from there via box outlet
    pipes into the atmosphere.</li>
  <li>Silencer pipe. Some of the silencer types are already active but in general the
    silencers are still under development. It is not recommended for use in this
    release.</li>
</ul>

<h2><u>Description of Main Exhaust types</u></h2>

<p>These are the more common types of
exhaust systems. They are general to any engine configuration and number of
cylinders except for the single cylinder that for obvious reasons cannot have
any sort of branch pipe.</p>

<h3>Individual Pipes</h3>

<p>This system has a pipe for each
cylinder. These pipes can each have a box or plenum or a silencer attached or
can be directly open to the atmosphere. The pipes can be stepped and be of the
megaphone type. Figure 1 shows a two-cylinder engine with a stepped pipe with
megaphones and box outlets.</p>

<p>Each pipe can also have a resonator tube added.</p>

<p>On a single cylinder engine the  pipe can also split into two outlets.</p>

<h3>Ninto1 Branch Manifolds</h3>

<p>These
are the so called “banana branch” type of exhaust manifolds. They are used
where maximum power is the aim. The header pipes and the collector pipe can be
stepped. The collector can be connected to a box/plenum, a silencer or directly
open to the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The 4into1 
manifold can also have resonator tubes added to the headers.</p>

<h3>Log Manifolds</h3>

<h3>Log Manifolds for Inline engines</h3>

<p>With a log manifold each cylinder is
connected to a common pipe. This is usually not found on a high performance
engine except on turbo-charged engines. This type is still under development and
will be described in detail once development is completed. Figure 3 shows a
four-cylinder engine with a log manifold.</p>

<p align="center">

<h3>Log Manifold for Inline engines with central outlet</h3>

<p>On some engines with log manifolds the exit is not at the end but in the 
center, almost as if it is two log manifolds joined in the middle of the engine. 
The next figure shows an example on an inline 6 cylinder engine:</p>

<h3>Log Manifolds for Vee and Flat engines</h3>

<p>Vee or Flat engines have log manifolds on each bank. The 
outlet of these manifolds can be separate or connected:</p>

<h2>Special Manifolds</h2>

<h3><b><u>V-12 and Flat-12 Engines</u></b></h3>

<p>There are a number of special configurations:</p>

<h3>1. 12into4into2</h3>

<p>Each bank of cylinders is connected to two three into one collectors. After each collector 
there is another collector joining the two systems per side. The layout and numbering convention
is shown in the next figure:</p>

<p align="center">
 <img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex12in4in2.jpg"></p>

<h3><b><u>V-6, V-8, Flat-6 and Flat-8 Engines</u></b></h3>

<p>There are a number of special configurations:</p>

<h3>1. Ninto2 (6into2 or 8into2) with an interconnecting pipe.</h3>

<p>Each bank of cylinders is connected to
a collector. After each collector there is another collector with an
interconnecting pipe joining the two system. The layout and numbering convention
is shown in the next figure:</p>

<p align="center">
 <img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex8in2Inter.jpg"></p>

<h3>2. Ninto2 (6into2 or 8into2)</h3>

<p>This is the same layout as the previous pipe but without the interconnecting pipe. 
The manifolds of the left and right bank operate as if they were from two separate 
inline engines. The system is shown in the next figure:</p>

<p align="center">

<h3>3. Ninto2into1 (6into2into1 or 8into2into1) with an interconnecting pipe.</h3>

<p>Each bank of cylinders is connected to a collector. After each collector there 
is another collector with an interconnecting pipe joining the two system after 
which the two main pipes join into a common collector pipe. The layout and 
numbering convention is shown in the next figure:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex8in2in1inter.jpg"></p>

<h3>4. Ninto2into1 (6into2into1 or 8into2into1)</h3>

<p>This is the same layout as pipe no 2 with the exception that the two pipes after the
main collectors join into a common collector pipe. The system is shown in the next figure:</p>

<p align="center">
 <img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex8in2in1.jpg"></p>

<h3>5. Ninto2intoX (6into2intoX or 8into2intoX) with an 
interconnecting pipe.</h3>

<p>Each bank of cylinders is connected to a collector. After each collector there 
is another collector with an interconnecting pipe joining the two system after which 
the two main pipes join into a common X-collector into two outlet pipes. The layout 
and numbering convention is shown in the next figure.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex8in2inXinter.jpg"></p>

<h3>6. Ninto2intoX (6into2intoX or 8into2intoX)</h3>

<p>This is the same layout as pipe no 2 with the exception that the two pipes after the
main collectors join into a common X-collector into two outlet pipes. The system is shown in
the next figure.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex8in2inX.jpg"></p>

<h3>7. Ninto2intoResonator (6into2intoResonator or 8into2intoResonator)</h3>

<p>This is the same layout as pipe no 2 with the exception that the two pipes after the
main collectors join into a resonator-collector into one outlet pipe. The system is shown in
the next figure.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex6in2in1-Resonator.jpg"></p>

<h3><u>American V8's only pipes</u></h3>

<p>In an effort to equalize the power produced by each cylinder in an engine
that uses the uneven firing order of an American V8 a special 8into4into2 pipe
was produced. The following four pipes are variations of this pipe:</p>
<h3>1. 8into4into2</h3>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex8in4in2.jpg"></p>

<h3>2. 8into4into2into1</h3>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex8in4in2in1.jpg"></p>

<h3>3. 8into4into2Interconnected</h3>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex8in4in2inter.jpg"></p>

<h3>4. 8into4into2into1Interconnected</h3>

<h3><u>Three-cylinder Engines</u></h3>

<p>There is one special pipe configuration:</p>
 
<h3>1. 3into1 with headers interconnected</h3>

<p>The three header pipes are joined by interconnector pipe3, after which they then 
join a common collector outlet.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex3%20into1%20-%20Interconnected.jpg"></p>

<h3><u>Two-cylinder Engines</u></h3>

<p>There are three special pipe configurations:</p>
 
<h3>1. 2into1into2</h3>

<p>The two header pipes are joined by a connector pipe, which then splits into two pipes
again.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex2in1in2.jpg"></p>

<h3>2. 2into2 with an interconnecting pipe</h3>

<p>The two header pipes are separate but joined by an interconnecting pipe. This is a
typical layout for a Ducati V2 engine.</p>

<p align="center">
 <img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex2in2inter.jpg"></p>

<h3>3. 2into2 with an interconnecting X-collector</h3>

<p>The two header pipes are separate but joined by an interconnecting 
<a href="../Contents/ExCollector.htm">X-collector</a>. This is a
typical layout for a Ducati V2 engine.</p>

<p align="center">
 <img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex2in2-Xcollector.jpg"></p>

<h3><u>Special Box or Plenum Pipes</u></h3>

<p>There are two special Box pipes depending on the engine layout:</p>

<h3>1. One common box on an Inline multi-cylinder.</h3>

<p>All the headers go directly into a common box.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex4_1box.jpg"></p>

<h3>2. Two common boxes, one per bank on a Vee or Flat engine</h3>

<p>All the headers per cylinder bank go directly into one of the boxes.</p>
