<title>Types of Turbocharger Exhaust Systems</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Types of Exhaust Systems for Turbocharged Engines</h1>

<p>There are three main general types of
exhaust systems available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Individual pipes per cylinder with a turbo on each cylinder.</li>
  <li>Ninto1 branch manifolds where N = number of cylinders.</li>
  <li>Log manifolds – all cylinders connect to a single pipe.</li>
</ul>

<p>On top of these “normal” pipes there is a range of special pipes available
depending on the engine types.</p>

<p>All the pipes can have one of three types of “collector outlets”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plain pipe. A normal plain opening to the atmosphere. </li>
  <li>Box pipe. The system flows into a box or plenum and from there via box outlet
    pipes into the atmosphere. </li>
  <li>Silencer pipe. Some of the silencer types are already active but in general the
    silencers are still under development. It is not recommended for use in this
    release.</li>
</ul>

<p>The turbocharger system can be with or without a wastegate.</p>

<h2><u>Modeling the Turbine Inlet Pipe</u></h2>

<p>The inlet pipe to the turbine must be extended to simulate the effect of 
the volute. On the turbocharger page there are information displayed that should be 
used to model the extra piece to be added to the turbine inlet pipe:</p>

<h2><u>Description of Main Exhaust types for Single Scroll Turbines</u></h2>

<p>These are the more common types of exhaust systems. They are general to any 
engine configuration and number of cylinders except for the single cylinder that 
for obvious reasons cannot have any sort of branch pipe.</p>

<h3>Individual Pipes</h3>

<p>This system has a pipe for each cylinder. The figures show a two-cylinder 
engine with a turbo on each cylinder, with and without a wastegate.</p>

<p align="center">

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Twin2Ex-TurboWastegate.jpg"></p>

<h3 >Ninto1 Branch Manifolds</h3>

<p>These are the so called “banana branch” type of exhaust manifolds. They are used
where maximum power is the aim. The header pipes and the collector pipe can be
stepped. The turbine outlet can be connected to a box/plenum, a silencer or directly
open to the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The next figure shows a 4into1 system without wastegate:</p>

<p>And with a wastegate:</p>

<h3>Log Manifolds</h3>

<h3>Log Manifolds for Inline engines with end outlet</h3>

<p>With a log manifold each cylinder is connected to a common pipe. The figure shows a
four-cylinder engine with a log manifold, with and without a wastegate:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex4Log-TurboNoWastegate.jpg"></p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex4Log-TurboWastegate.jpg"></p>

<h3>Log Manifold for Inline engines with central outlet</h3>

<p>On some engines with log manifolds the exit is not at the end but in the 
center, almost as if it is two log manifolds joined in the middle of the engine. 
The next figures show examples on an inline 6 cylinder engine, with and without 
wastegate:</p>

<h3>Log Manifolds for Vee and Flat engines</h3>

<p>Vee or Flat engines have log manifolds on each bank. The 
outlet of these manifolds can be separate or connected:</p>

<h2>Special Manifolds</h2>

<h3><u>V-6, V-8, Flat-6 and Flat-8 Engines</u></h3>

<p>There are a number of special configurations:</p>

<h3>1. Ninto2 (6into2 or 8into2)</h3>

<p>This is the same layout as the
previous pipe but without the interconnecting pipe. The manifolds of the left
and right bank operate as if they were from two separate inline engines. The
system is shown in Figure 5.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex8in2-TurboWastegate.jpg"></p>

<h3>2. Ninto2into1 (6into2into1 or 8into2into1)</h3>
<p>This is the same layout as pipe no 2 with the exception that the two pipes after the
main collectors join into a common collector pipe. The system is shown in Figure 7.</p>

<h3><u>American V8's only pipes</u></h3>

<p>In an effort to equalize the power produced by each cylinder in an engine
that uses the uneven firing order of an American V8 a special 8into4into2 pipe
was produced. The following four pipes are variations of this pipe.</p>

<h3>1. 8into4into2</h3>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex8in4in2in1-TurboWastegate.jpg"></p>

<h3><u>Inline 4-cylinder Engines</u></h3>

<p>There are three special configurations and they are all a variation of a 4into2into1 system:</p>

<p>1. Cylinders 1 and 2 into one connector pipe, 3 and 4 into another connector and the two connector pipes into
a common collector pipe.</p>

<p>2. Cylinders 1 and 3 into one connector pipe, 2 and 4 into another connector and the two connector pipes into
a common collector pipe.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex4in2in1B-TurboNoWastegate.jpg"></p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex4in2in1B-TurboWastegate.jpg"></p>

<p>3. Cylinders 1 and 4 into one connector pipe, 2 and 3 into another connector and the two connector pipes into
a common collector pipe.</p>

<h2><u>Description of Main Exhaust types for Twin Scroll Turbines</u></h2>

<p>All pipe configurations meant for two turbos with a single scroll volute can 
also be used for a single turbo with a twin scroll volute.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex8in2-TwinScrollTurboWastegate.jpg"></p>

<h3><u>Inline 4-cylinder Engines</u></h3>

<p>There are three special configurations and they are all a variation of a 4into2intoTurbine system:</p>

<p>1. Cylinders 1 and 2 into one connector pipe, 3 and 4 into another connector and the two connector pipes into
the turbine.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex4in2C_TwinScroll2Wastegate4T.jpg"></p>

<p>2. Cylinders 1 and 3 into one connector pipe, 2 and 4 into another connector and the two connector pipes into
the turbine.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex4in2B_TwinScroll2Wastegate4T.jpg"></p>

<p>3. Cylinders 1 and 4 into one connector pipe, 2 and 3 into another connector and the two connector pipes into
the turbine.</p>

<h3><u>Inline 6-cylinder Engines</u></h3>

<p>There are two special configurations and they are both a variation of the double log collector system. One has 
the turbine in the center of the log manifold and the other the turbine is at the one end:</p>
