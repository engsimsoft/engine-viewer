<h1><u>Archiving or Extracting an Existing Project</u></h1>

<h2>Archived Projects</h2>

<p>This facility allows project files to be archived or "packed" to either keep 
backup files of the current state of the project or to send the project to 
another user of the software to allow project and file sharing. When creating 
such an archive the file will be stored in the working folder which normally is 
"C:\4Stroke" and it will have the project name 
as its name with the ".pack" extension. This file contains all the 
info of the project that is part of the project at that moment, this includes 
the optional files (Batch Run RPM file, flow bench files and imported lift profile files) 
if they exist, and including the turbo compressor and turbine maps.</p>

<h2>Extracting an existing archive</h2>
<p>After clicking on the OK- button on the start-up page the following dialog box
will appear:</p>

 <p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/EmptyProjectDialog.jpg"></p>

<p>Click the "<b>Unpack Archive</b>"<b> button. </b>The dialog box will list all the available 
archived files in the working folder. To
select an existing archive click on the archive name and click the "<b>Open</b>"- 
button or double click on the archive name. In this case we select the I4-Turbo archive.</p>

<p><b>Warning: During the 
unpack process any file that has the same name as a file in the archive will be 
over-written by the unpack process.</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/ExistingArchiveDialog.jpg"></p>

<p align="center">If the unpack or extraction process 
was successful, the following message box is displayed:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/UnpackMessageBox.jpg"></p>

<p align="center">The subsystems of project I4-Turbo are now displayed in the project dialog:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/FilledExistingProjectDialog.jpg"></p>

<p align="center">
The unpacked project is now available and can be used as a normal project.</p>

<h2 align="center">Packing or Creating an Archive File</h2>
<p align="center">
The project edit dialog box is used to create or pack an archive file:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/EditDialog.jpg" width="830" height="525"></p>

<p align="left">
Click the "<b>Pack Archive</b>"<b> button. </b>This will create an archive file 
with the same name as the project file but with the ".pack" file extension and 
will save it in the working folder if successful. On successful completion of 
the archiving process the following message box will be displayed:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/PackMessageBox.jpg" width="514" height="144"></p>

<p><b>Warning: During the 
pack process any pack file that has the same name as the project file will be 
over-written by the pack process.</b></font></p>

<p align="left">
This file can now be saved or sent to another user.</p>


<h2>Save the Project with New Name</h2>
<p align="left">
This button creates a new project name and saves all the files with this name.</p>

<p><b>Warning1: If files with the new name 
already exists they will be over written without warning.</b></font></p>

<p><b>Warning2: During this renaming
only the subsystem files will be saved under a new name. Imported files like turbocharger 
maps, camshaft lift profiles and flowbench files  will not be copied to new files.</b></font></p>
