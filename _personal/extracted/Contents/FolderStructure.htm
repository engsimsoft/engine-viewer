<title>Folder Structure</title>

<h1>The Folder Structure used by the EngMod4T Suite of Programs</h1>

<p>During the installation process the installer software creates the program folders and 
the working folder as well as shortcut Icons on the desktop. Unless you know how to change 
a target folder for a program it is strongly recommended that you use the default file 
structure.</p>

<ol>Folders Created:

  <li><b>C:\4Stroke</b> - This is the working folder where all the Project files is stored.</li>
  <li><b>C:\Program Files (x86)\Dat4T</b> - The Dat4T executable, license file and Help files are installed to this folder.</li>
  <li><b>C:\Program Files (x86)\EngMod4T</b> - The EngMod4T executable, license file and Help file are installed to this folder.</li>
  <li><b>C:\Program Files (x86)\Post4T</b> - The Post4T executable and Help file are installed to this folder.</li>
  <li><b>C:\Program Files (x86)\Waveviewer4T</b> - The WaveViewer4T executable and Help files are installed to this folder.</li>

</ol>

<p>Only the first folder is of any interest if everything is normal. The other folders are 
only accessed if there are issues with the software, most often when Windows decides to install 
the license file somewhere else. A typical executable folder looks as follows:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/SuiteFolder-07.jpg"></p>

<h2>Working Folder - "C:\4Stroke"</h2>

<p>The working folder is the one we are interested in. It is created when the software is installed and 
populated with some examples to supply a starting point for the new user to get up to speed.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/SuiteFolder-01.jpg"></p>

<p>Double clicking on the "C:\4Stroke" icon opens the working folder. Normally there would be a large 
number of files in this folder but to make it easier to explain there is only one Project loaded: 
Blast. The folder shown below is after running a single simulation:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/SuiteFolder-02.jpg"></p>

<p>There are a number of files in this folder other than directly Project related files and they are 
as follows with the following functions:</p>

<ol>

  <li><b>Dat4TErrorLog.dat</b> - Every time Dat4T is started a new file is over written over the old one and 
  It stores all the errors and commands used. Send this file with an error report when Dat4T gives a funny 
  error or crashes, before opening Dat4T again as that will just over write the file.</li>
  <li><b>Dat4TLicenseCheck.dat</b> - Certain parts in Dat4T is only available if you have a valid license 
  and this logs the checks.</li>
  <li><b>EngMod4TLicenseCheck.dat</b> - Every time EngMod4T is started the validity of the license is first 
  verified. If you have any license issues please send this file.</li>
  <li><b>OldEngMod4TFile.fle</b> - This stores the choices made during the previous EngMod4T run to save 
  time selecting them if the next run will use the same parameters.</li>
  <li><b>OldProjectFile.fle</b> - This stores the previous Project opened by Dat4T and loads it when Dat4T 
  is opened again.</li>
  <li><b>Post4TErrorLog.dat</b> - Every time Post4T is started a new file is over written over the old one and 
  It stores all the errors and commands used. Send this file with an error report when Post4T gives a funny 
  error or crashes, before opening Post4T again as that will just over write the file.</li>
  <li><b>Post4TWorkDir.dat</b> - Stores the Post4T working folder of the previous run, not yet used for anything.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Project Folder - "C:\4Stroke\Blast"</h2>

<h3>Single Run Results</h3>

<p>Once a simulation of a Project is run a folder is created with the name of the Project and all the 
result files are stored in this folder. We double click on the "Blast" folder icon in the Project 
folder to open it:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/SuiteFolder-03.jpg"></p>

<p>In this folder is a list of all the simulation results at 8000rpm, they are the files with the "8000" 
appended to the name but before the extention. These are the files used by Post4T to display the "Trace" 
values. There are also three new files without the "8000" in the name. They are the following and is 
used for specific outputs:</p>

<ol>

  <li><b>Blast.dat</b> - This file (.dat) lists the running of the main simulator, EngMod4T, and captures 
      errors. Any time a simulation crashes this is the file you send to report the error and ask for assistance.</li>
  <li><b>Blast.des</b> - The detonation results for a single run is stored in this file (.des). To see the 
      values inside it, open it with a normal text editor, something like "Wordpad" or "Notepad++".</li>
  <li><b>Blast.spo</b> - The performance results for a single run is stored in this file (.spo). To see the 
      values inside it, open it with a normal text editor, something like "Wordpad" or "Notepad++".</li>

</ol>

<p>Note that both the last two files are appended during each batch run so the performance and detonation results are 
just added during each run.</p>

<h3>Batch Run Results</h3>

<p>After a "Batch" run there are a lot more files with the results for each rpm point in the batch run. There are 
now two new files which we are interested in.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/SuiteFolder-04.jpg"></p>

<p>The following two files are of interest:</p>

<ol>

  <li><b>Blast.det</b> - The detonation results for a batch run is stored in this file (.det). To see the 
      values inside it, open it with Post4T.</li>
  <li><b>Blast.pou</b> - The performance results for a batch run is stored in this file (.pou). To see the 
      values inside it, open it with Post4T.</li>

</ol>

<p>Note that both these files are appended during each batch run so the performance and detonation results are just 
added during each run.</p>

<h3>Advanced Users</h3>

<p>There are three files created with each RPM point that lists the instantaneous port open area against crank angle. 
These files are not opened by Post4T but requires Microsoft Excel to open and plot.</p>

<ol>

  <li><b>Blast8000.epa</b> - This file (.epa) lists the exhaust port open area against crank angle.</li>
  <li><b>Blast8000.ipa</b> - This file (.ipa) lists the inlet port open area against crank angle.</li>

</ol>
