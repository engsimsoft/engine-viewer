<h2><u><b>Absorption Silencer</b></u></h2>
<p><font size="3">The absorption silencer is the most common high performance
engine silencer. Correctly sized it has almost no negative effect on the engine
performance. It is commonly known as a &quot;free flow&quot; silencer. It
consists of a straight through inner tube that is perforated and with the space
between the inner and outer tube packed with some absorption material like glass
wool. The number and size of the holes define the &quot;opacity&quot; of the
silencer and the density of the packing the &quot;density&quot; of the silencer.
The following figure shows the main dimensions of an absorption silencer.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Depending on the opacity of the silencer one of
two ways can be used to model the silencer. </font></p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="4">1: Absorption Silencer modeled as branches
with interconnected plenums</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">For an opacity of less than 0.45 the silencer can 
be
modeled as a series of branches with side plenums, almost like a row of
side-resonant silencers. The plenums are connected with interconnecting pipes of
which the diameter depends on the density. The side branch diameter depends on
the opacity and the plenum volume on the total silencer volume. The following
figure shows the internal modeling as performed by the software.</font></p>

dimensions from the main dimensions as supplied by the user. The next screen
shows a typical example of the input data.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">The user can also prescribe the number of 
sections and 
their dimensions of the perforated tube&nbsp;and the software determines all the rest 
of the relevant
dimensions from the main dimensions as supplied by the user. The next screen

<p align="left"><b><font size="4">2: Absorption Silencer modeled as a series of
inline plenums and pipes</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">For an opacity of more than 0.25 the silencer can 
be
modeled as a series of inline plenums connected by short pipes. The following
figure shows the internal modeling as performed by the software.</font></p>
