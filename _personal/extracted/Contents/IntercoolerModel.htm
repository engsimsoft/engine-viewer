<h1><u>Creating or Editing an Intercooler</u></h1>

<p>When modeling a turbo or supercharged inlet system there is an option to use an 
intercooler or more correctly, a charge air cooler. If selecting the "Yes" radio button for 
intercooler a new field opens that requires the cooler data:</p>

<p align="center">

<p>The input data required is the following:</p>

<h2>Number of Intercoolers</h2>

<p>On some systems it is possible to fit more than one intercooler in parallel and for such 
a system the choice has to be made at this point.</p>

<h2>Coolant Type</h2>

<p>The cooler can be of the air-air type or the water-air type. For short distance races 
like drag racing water is often used as the cooling medium where the cooler is in a tank 
that is filled with ice water before each race. For a short duration this can extract a 
large amount of heat.
<br>
For longer duration usage the air-air cooler is more common and the normal atmospheric air 
is used as the cooling medium. It cannot absorb as much heat as water but it is continually 
refreshed. It requires a much larger cooler.</p>

<h2>Material</h2>

<p>Coolers can be made from either aluminium or copper. Aluminium has a higher heat transfer 
rate and is lighter but less robust and more expensive. It is rare to see a cooler for competition 
use to be manufactured from anything other than aluminium.</p>

<h2>Single or Double Pass</h2>

<p>A single pass cooler is more efficient as the whole cooler is exposed to cold cooling 
medium (air or water) but sometimes it is not possible because of packaging constraints 
to fit the required size cooler so one is made that doubles back on itself. That means 
that the cooling air passes through the one core and is heated up before it passes through 
the second core.</p>

<h2>Header Tank Volume (cc)</h2>

<p>This is the volume of each of the two tanks that is on the inlet and outlet side of 
the cooler.</p>

<p align="center">

<h2>Center Tank Volume (cc)</h2>

<p>If a double pass intercooler is used there is an extra tank that joins the two cores.</p>

<h2>Coolant Temperature (°C)</h2>

<p>This is the temperature of the air or water that is used as the cooling medium. In the 
case of air it is usually the ambient air temperature. In the case of water it can be a 
dedicated water tank with ice water or part of the engine cooling system.</p>

<h2>Coolant Velocity (m/s)</h2>

<p>This is the speed that the cooling medium flows through the core. For a vehicle using the 
free stream airflow is is normal to use about 75% of the maximum vehicle speed. For water 
this can be zero for a static tank or the speed that the water is pumped through the core.</p>

<h2>Intercooler Efficiency</h2>

<p>This is the ratio between the actual temperature drop of the inlet air and the 
theoretically possible temperature drop. This is usually in the 0.65 to 0.75 range 
(65% to 75%).</p>

<h2>Number of Tubes (From Header Tank to Header Tank)</h2>

<p>This is the total number of tubes in the core that the inlet air flows through. There can 
be one or more rows of tubes. The next picture shows an example of the number of rows in a 
single row cooler (If this was a double row intercooler there would be 48 tubes):</p>

<p align="center">

<h2>Tube Major Dimension (Of Tubes flowing from Header Tank to Header Tank)</h2>

<p>This is the inside width of each tube, as shown in the next picture (Note that the 
intercooler shown in the picture has a single row of tubes):</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/CAC-05.jpg"></p>

<h2>Tube Minor Dimension (Of Tubes flowing from Header Tank to Header Tank)</h2>

<p>This is the inside breedth of each inner tube that flows from tank to tank, 
as shown in the next picture:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/CAC-08.jpg"></p>

<h2>Tube Length (Of Tubes flowing from Header Tank to Header Tank)</h2>

<p>This is the cooling length of each tube, as shown in the next picture:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/CAC-02.jpg"></p>

<h2>Tube Wall Thickness (Of Tubes flowing from Header Tank to Header Tank)</h2>

<p>This is the thickness of the material the tubes are made from and is typically 
between 0.3 and 0.4mm thick. This is a very important criteria as it plays a large 
role in the rate of heat transfer.</p>

<h2>General Discussion</h2>

<p>The software calculates the internal flow area of each tube and from that it 
calculates and displays the effective tube diameter if the tube was round. It also
calculates and displays the effective diameter of the sum of all the the tube flow 
areas added together. As the tubes has a fairly high flow resistance because of 
internal fins and turbulators to aid heat transfer, this diameter should be about 
50% bigger than the tube flowing into the intercooler.</p>
