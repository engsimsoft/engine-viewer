 <h1>Types of V8 Intake Systems</h1>

 <p>There is a large number of inlet systems available for V8 engines. With some
 pipes like independent runners connected to the atmosphere there is no ambiguity
 in the modeling process. However, when a plenum is involved the model is not so 
 clearcut or obvious. A plenum as modeled in 1-dimensional gasdynamics is a 
 0-dimensional item and does not transmit waves over a distance with time delay 
 but transmits it instantaneously. If the plenum  is in a part of the manifold 
 where this will have a significant influence on the wave action it should rather 
 be modeled as a series of large diameter pipes.</p>

 <p>The following shows some examples of inlet systems and how they are modeled 
 in Dat4T:</p>

<h2>Independent Runners</h2>

<p>There is no ambiguity in modeling this inlet.</p>

<p>To model this inlet the following manifold type and manifold layout is selected:</p>

<h2>Independent Runners connected to a Plenum per bank - Cross Ram</h2>

<p>In this case it is clearly required to model the two plenums as a combination of pipes.
If the plenum was much larger the choice is no longer so obvious and might require modeling 
it using either method and comparing the results.</p>

<p>To model this inlet the following manifold type and inlet configurations are selected:</p>

<p>In the case where the plenums are much larger in diameter to the extent where the wave 
action in the plenum is so small as to be negligable it can be modeled as two plenums:</p>

<p>To model this inlet the following manifold type and inlet configurations are selected:</p>

<h2>Single Plane Manifold</h2>

<p>A single plane manifold typically has a very small "plenum" where all the runners collect 
to the inlet pipe (Which is the effective diameter of all the carburettor pipes combined).</p>

<p>To model this inlet the following manifold type and inlet configurations are selected:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../Pictures/Menu-SinglePlane-Collector.jpg"></p>

<p>If the plenum is very large or the inlet wave action not important the single plane manifold 
can be modeled as a plenum into which the inlets and runners connect:</p>

<h2>Dual Plane Manifold</h2>

<p>A dual plane manifold typically has two very small "plenums" where the runners collect 
to the inlet pipes (Which is the effective diameters of the connected carburettor pipes).</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../Pictures/V8_DualPlaneUpdate.jpg"></p>

<p>To model this inlet the following manifold type and inlet configurations are selected:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../Pictures/Menu-DualPlane-Collector.jpg"></p>

<p>If the plenums are very large or the inlet wave action not important the dual plane manifold 
can be modeled as two plenums into which the inlet pipes and runners connect:</p>

<h2>Tunnel Ram Manifold with One Inlet - Spaced Runners</h2>

<p>There is a single effective inlet into the tunnel. This inlet can be the sum of a single 
barrel, two barrel or four barrel carburetor or throttle body. The runners join the tunnel 
with a space between them requiring extra "collector joints" to model.</p>

<h2>Tunnel Ram Manifold with One Inlet - Adjacent Runners</h2>

<p>There is a single effective inlet into the tunnel. This inlet can be the sum of a single 
barrel, two barrel or four barrel carburetor or throttle body. The runners join the tunnel 
in adjacent pairs requiring two 6 pipe collector joints.</p>

barrel, two barrel or four barrel carburetor or throttle body. The runners join the tunnel
