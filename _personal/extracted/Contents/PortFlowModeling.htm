Through Ports and Valves</span></h1>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">The flow through the valves and ports are modeled using 
gasdynamics and discharge coefficients. It is based on the work of the late <a HREF="References.htm">
Professor Emeritus Gordon P Blair</a> of The Queen's University of Belfast.</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">In modeling a port in 1-dimensional gasdynamic simulation 
software certain assumptions and simplifications must be made. The following discusses these for the 
EngMod4T program. Other vendors might make different trade-offs but they all will have to make 
some.</span></p>

<h2>Description of dimensional port and valve input data</h2>

<p>The following figure shows the input required to model an inlet port:</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US"><b>Number of Valves:</b> This is the number of valves per 
cylinder and can vary from 1 to 3 for inlet valves and 1 or 2 for exhaust valves.</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US"><b>Valve and Port Dimensions: </b>These values are straight 
forward. It is important to note that the software will automatically adjust the port diameters from 
the manifold diameter up to the effective throat diameter. The effective throat diameter is the 
throat diameter adjusted for the effect of the valve stem diameter. They will be discussed in detail 
in the inlet port and exhaust port topics.</span></p>

<h2>Effect of Seat Dimensions on the Valve and in the Head on Effective Flow Area</h2>

<p>The software uses the smallest available flow area through the valve open apperture times the Cd-value 
as the area through which the gas flows. This area is dependent on the seat dimensions on the valve 
and in the head. The two major controlling dimensions are the seat inside diameter on the valve and 
the seat outside diameter in the head. The next figure shows the possible combinations of these "major" 
dimensions:</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" align="center">

<p>The next graph shows the effect on flow area by having first only the inner seat diameter on the valve 
decreased by 3mm, then the effect of increasing only the outer diameter of the seat in the head by 3mm 
and finally doing both. The graph goes from the valve opening point to the fully open point:</p>

<h2>Description of the Cd maps</h2>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">During the flow through a valve the flow is less than what 
the flow theoretical flow through the open area would have been. The ratio of the measured flow to 
the theoretical flow is known as the “coefficient of discharge” and is usually abbreviated as Cd. 
This Cd value is a function of how far the valve is open and the pressure ratio across the valve. 
If we create a map of the Cd as a function of both the valve open ratio and the pressure ratio we 
end up with a typical Cd map as shown in the next figure (the often used 28” of water pressure used 
on a flow bench gives a pressure ratio of 1.07 which is very slightly above the x axis).
 (from SAE2001-01-1798):

<p class="MsoBodyText" align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Cd-Map.jpg" width="451" height="402"></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">The Cd value is actually of the complete port and takes the losses through 
the “venturi”, the flow around the short side radius and around the valve guide and valve stem into 
consideration as well as the valve seat and valve masking effects. This map is one of the inputs 
into EngMod4T and that is why it is stated EngMod4T takes the flow loss into of the smallest cross 
sectional area into consideration irrespective of where it is.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">The following figure shows how the flow through the valve opening migrates 
as a function of pressure ratio, lift and engine rpm. It is clear that the flow on an engine 
spends very little time at the 28” line (1.07).</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" align="center">

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Very few people have the facilities to measure a port 
to construct a Cd map. Getting just the Cd value at a specific pressure ratio (i.e. at 28” of 
water on a flow bench) is a lot more common. Because of this there are three ways in EngMod4T 
to describe the flow through a port and valve combination:</span></p>

<ol>
	<li>1)	If no flow data is available the user selects the most appropriate type of flow
	<li>2)	If flow bench data is available this data is used to construct a Cd-map
	<li>3)	Import a full Cd map
</ol>

<h3>No Flow Data Available</h3>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">For case 1 a number of Cd maps for 1, 2 and 3 valve 
inlet ports and 1 and 2 valve exhaust ports ranging from severely masked to fully free flow 
has been included in the software to allow the user a choice of what he thinks approximates 
his engine best.</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US"><b>Severely Masked</b> is defined where the combustion 
chamber and/or cylinder wall restricts the flow through the valve open aperture over more than 
90 degrees of its circumference and with a clearance of less than half the valve lift. The 
following figure shows it schematically:</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/ValveMaskingSevere.jpg" width="451" height="264"></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US"><b>Partially Masked</b> is defined where the 
combustion chamber and/or cylinder wall restricts the flow through the valve open 
aperture 
over less than 90 degrees of its circumference with a clearance bigger than half the valve 
lift but smaller than the full valve lift. Almost all 4 and 5 valve heads fall in this 
category. The following figure shows it schematically:</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/ValveMaskingPartial.jpg" width="470" height="264"></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US"><b>Free Flowing</b> is where the combustion
chamber and cylinder walls have almost no detrimental effect on the flow through the valve 
aperture. The following figure shows it schematically:</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/ValveMaskingFree.jpg" width="450" height="264"></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">To allow further fine tuning of the Cd-map there 
are multipliers. A severely masked Cd map multiplied with a factor of 1.2 is roughly the 
same as a partially masked Cd map multiplied by 0.8, and the same way a partially masked 
Cd map multiplied by 1.2 flows roughly the same as a free flowing Cd map multiplied by 0.8.
Using this together with good judgement and experience the effect of flow improvements in 
the chamber can be modeled.</span></p>

<h3>Flow Bench Data Available</h3>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">When a port is measured on a flow bench and the Cd 
value for each valve lift at a specific pressure ratio is known this Cd curve is used to modify 
an existing Cd map to closely approximate the map for that port. This is described in 
<a HREF="InCd-map.htm">"User Defined Cd-Map"</a></span></p>

<h3>Cd-Map Available</h3>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">If the user has access to fully prepared Cd maps they 
can import those directly.</span></p>
