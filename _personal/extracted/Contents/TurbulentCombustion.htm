<h1>Combustion Modeling</h1>
<p>All combustion in the spark ignition internal combustion engine happens as
turbulent combustion. If this was not the case the maximum rpm achieved would
have been around 800rpm as the laminar burn rate is way too slow. The next
paragraph gives a brief overview of turbulent combustion followed by a
description of the combustion models used in simulations.</p>
<h2>Brief Description of Turbulent Combustion</h2>
<p> Turbulent eddies are created from the bulk flow of the fluid. Kinetic energy
is taken from the bulk flow and transformed into turbulent energy (the spinning
of the turbulent eddy). The size of these eddies are in part determined by the
size of the container or duct and in our engines are typically between 5 and 20mm
diameter depending on the cylinder and transfer port sizes. (This size is known as the integral length scale) These eddies break
down into progressively smaller eddies down to eddies of about 0.5 to 1mm. (The
Taylor length scale) It is at this size that combustion takes place. (These
eddies are damped out by the viscous forces in the fluid at an even smaller
scale known as the Kolmogorov scale. This break down of bulk flow to large
eddies to small eddies to viscous damping of the eddies is known as the
&quot;Turbulent Cascade&quot; model.) These
eddies are ignited on the surface by coming into contact with already burning
eddies. They burn inward at the laminar burning rate over which we have no
control other than mixture quality and purity. Only the initial ignited eddy
burns from the inside out as it is ignited by the spark in the spark plug gap.
The time taken from spark to the flame reaching the surface of this first eddy
is the delay time from spark to combustion proper starting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To decrease the delay time we need to increase the strength and duration of
the spark to ignite as much of this first eddy as good possible. The size of
this spark also needs to be at least the size of a turbulent eddy. Bigger does
not really help because one or two eddies burning at the laminar rate has no
real effect on the delay time. Increasing the spark strength and duration past
the point where the eddy has been fully ignited will also have no or a very
small effect. This partially explains why some engines show a performance 
improvement with a bigger gap - they have larger turbulent eddies.</p>
<p>To increase combustion rate we have to spin these eddies faster to come
into contact with non burning eddies at a faster rate. This is why faster
spinning eddies (higher turbulent intensity) results in a faster combustion. It
also implies that combustion happens at a specific rate. Uncontrolled combustion
is where these eddies ignite because of a sharp temperature and pressure rise.
This is an uncontrolled event and if enough eddies ignite we have detonation
which is definitely uncontrolled!</p>
<p>The above process is chaotic and leads to big variations in burn rate and max
pressure. In &quot;bad&quot; engines more than 600 measured pressure traces has
to be averaged to obtain the average pressure trace. Having such a big spread
means we have to set the operating point far from optimum as some of the cycles
the pressure and temperature will exceed the value where detonation happen. The
smaller we can make the cyclic variation the closer we can set the operating
point to the detonation limit. This means that the more &quot;control&quot; we
can impose on the turbulence formation the more repeatable we can make it, thus
limiting cyclic variation and increasing the allowable compression ratio.</p>
<p>The only practical way we have is to control the bulk motion. Bulk flow
distributes these eddies in a more controlled way and impose some control on the
process. Spark ignition 4 strokes use mainly two methods: Swirl and Tumble.
Swirl is created by having an offset inlet port so that the in cylinder flow is
swirling around the cylinder axis. Uniflow 2strokes also use this principle.
Tumble is created using 2 inlet valves and directing flow such that the gas in
the cylinder starts rotating around an axis perpendicular to the cylinder axis.
Most modern high performance 4stroke engines use this and it is the reason why
backyard porters often destroy an engine's performance even if quoting huge flow
numbers - they messed up the tumble flow!</p>
<p>So back to the 2stroke - we need a way to control bulk flow without messing 
up the scavenge process. We do our best with squish flow but as we all know, 
results will vary from model to model and even from engine to engine! We all 
agree (I think) that MSV is an indication and can be used with great success on 
similar engines (usually). We do not have sufficient and/or repeatable 
control over the turbulence creation process to use MSV as an exact indicator.</p>

<h2>Modeling of Combustion</h2>
<p>To model combustion in a simulation package there are various approaches the
developer can use and it depends on the time he is willing to spend on the model
as well as on the typical user requirement and capabilities. The following is a
list of most of the major types of models listed from the more simplistic to the
more complex:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Prescribed heat release. The developer programs a heat release rate curve
    into the software. The user has only control over the spark timing and the
    combustion duration. The chamber geometry is ignored.</li>
  <li>Prescribed burn rate. This model goes one step further in that the shape
    of the mass fraction burn rate is described by the user. Mass fraction burnt
    is usually a curve that is S-shaped. To describe this the model uses
    typically a Sine function or a Wiebe (Vibe) function to describe the
    S-shape. The user supplies the constants that describe the form of this
    function. The user also supplies the ignition timing, the delay period
    length and the duration of the combustion. The chamber geometry is ignored.</li>
  <li>Turbulent eddy entrainment. The turbulent intensity is calculated by the
    simulation and from this and the mixture purity and AFR, the laminar and
    turbulent burn rates are determined. This is then used to calculate the burn
    rate. The user supplies the ignition timing. The major characteristics of
    the chamber is included and squish action is calculated. Blending radiuses
    are ignored but dome shape and piston crown shape are used to calculate the
    flame front characteristics.</li>
  <li>LES (Large Eddy Simulation, a 3dimensional simulation) This is a CFD
    simulation (Computational Fluid Dynamics) that is fully 3dimensional and
    takes all the geometry into consideration. It uses cell sizes that capture
    the Taylor eddies but use a model to describe the turbulence further down
    the length scale. It has typical run times of hours to do one simulation.</li>
  <li>DNS (Direct Numerical Simulation, a 3dimensional simulation) This is also
    a CFD simulation but uses cell sizes small enough to calculate turbulence
    down to its smallest scales. It uses many millions of cells to model the
    engine geometry and has run times of days to weeks to do a simulation.</li>
</ol>
<p>EngMod4T uses models of type 2 and 3. The user has the choice between the two
types.</p>
<h2><u>Prescribed Burn Rate Model</u></h2>
<p>There are several Prescribed Burn Rate Models available of which the most 
popular one is the Vibe or Wiebe function model. The Vibe model is used as the 
prescribed burn rate model in EngMod4T. This model uses the following equation 
as its basis:</p>
<p align="center">

<p align="center">

&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: -4; margin-bottom: -4">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/VibeParameters.jpg" width="350" height="207"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This equation results in an S-shaped function of which the 
shape is controlled by the Vibe parameters.</p>
<h3>The effect of VibeA</h3>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/VibeA.jpg" width="375" height="413"></p>
<p align="left">
Increasing the &quot;slope&quot; shape factor increases the burn rate slope as shown in 
the figure.</p>
<h3 align="left">The effect of VibeM</h3>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/VibeM.jpg" width="383" height="423"></p>
<p align="left">
Increasing the &quot;distribution&quot; shape factor means more of the mass is burnt 
later.</p>
<h3 align="left">Using the Vibe Model</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The user has to supply 5 values to prescribe the burn rate 
using this model:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Ignition Timing - The timing of the spark in degrees before 
TDC</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Delay Period - The time from spark to turbulent combustion 
in crank angle degrees</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Burn Duration - The time from the end of the delay period 
to the end of turbulent combustion in crank angle degrees</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">VibeA - The &quot;slope&quot; shape factor</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">VibeM - The &quot;distribution&quot; shape factor</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2><u>Calculated Burn Rate (Turbulent Eddy Entrainment Model)</u> </h2>

<p>EngMod4T uses the turbulent eddy entrainment model to calculate the burn rate
and the &quot;Energy Cascade&quot; turbulent model to calculate the turbulent
intensity and from that the eddy entrainment rate. It uses the transfer port
flow as the main creator of turbulence with some help from the plugging pulse of
the exhaust. After port closure some further turbulence is generated by the
moving piston and the squish action while turbulence is damped out by the fluid
viscosity. </p>

<p>As this is a fully 3dimensional situation modeled by zero and 1-dimensional
equations it is not a fully robust method and can fail (give inaccurate
predictions) under certain conditions. It is based on 3dimensional equations but
with simplifying assumptions like homogeneity at small scales to remove
direction from the equation at the small scale turbulence. Large scale movement
are partially taken into consideration using the transfer port flow, the piston
movement and squish action but finer detail is lost through the use of
turbulence generation models based on average flow. Even so, the model works
quite well under most conditions. </p>

<h3>Using the Turbulent Entrainment Model </h3>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Strictly speaking
the user has to supply 1 value only to use this model:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Ignition Timing - The timing of the spark in degrees before 
TDC</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">However, to enable
the user to select between the two models the following values have to be
supplied as well:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Delay Period - The time from spark to turbulent combustion 
in crank angle degrees</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Burn Duration - The time from the end of the delay period 
to the end of turbulent combustion in crank angle degrees</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">VibeA - The &quot;slope&quot; shape factor</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">VibeM - The &quot;distribution&quot; shape factor</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">When using this
model the user must verify that the model is calculating realistic results. To
do this the model calculates the previous 4 values, (delay period, burn
duration, vibeA and vibeM) after each rpm point and stores the results in the
power output file. After a run the user can then plot them using Post4T and
inspect them for realism. The following figures show a comparison between using the
prescribed values as published, then using the turbulent entrainment model and 
then the calculated values as input for a simulation:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/turbulentvibepower.jpg" width="813" height="597"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/delayduration.jpg" width="825" height="585"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/vibeavibem.jpg" width="824" height="587"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">The
turbulent entrainment model increases run times quite a bit so a typical way to
use it is to do a baseline simulation using it to predict the 4 values required
by the Vibe model and then to use these values as input to the Vibe model and
use it then for further simulations.</p>
