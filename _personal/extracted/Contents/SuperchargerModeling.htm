<h2>Supercharger Modeling</h2>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>NOTE: This is the third release of the supercharger 
module and a number of options discussed here are not yet available but under 
development.</b></font></p>

<p>A supercharger is modeled by importing a compressor map. This map can be for a 
Centrifugal or a Twin Screw (Twin Lobe or Roots) blower. Once this is done the rest 
of the supercharger characteristics are added. To select a supercharged 
engine the following radio button is selected on the <b>main engine dialog</b>:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/TurboEngineMenuSuper.jpg"></p>

<p><b>NOTE: </b>After changing a naturally aspirated engine to a Supercharged engine on the main engine dialog 
you have to first create the new Supercharger subsystem and then create the new Inlet subsystem that connects to 
the new Supercharger.</p>

<p>After saving the engine subsystem the supercharger dialog will open:</p>

<h3>Blower Type or Compressor Type</h3>

<p>Two types can be modeled, a Centrifugal compressor and a Twin Screw compressor (also known as 
a twin lobe or as a Roots compressor) and one must be selected from the following two radio buttons:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/BlowerType.jpg"></p>

<p>If "Centrifugal" is selected extra information about the compressor is displayed. Initially 
until a compressor map is selected the values will be zero:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/CentrifugalDataZero.jpg"></p>

<h3>Boost Control on Compressor Side</h3>

<p>The boost pressure can be controlled on the compressor side 
by using a "blow off valve" or a "bypass valve" control. Blow off is inefficient as 
pressure is just bled to atmosphere. Bypass control is also used to control 
boost but feeds the blown of air back in line before the compressor and is used to 
prevent compressor surge during sudden shutting of the throttle.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/SuperBoostControl.jpg"></p>

<p>Selecting to control the boost opens extra input edit boxes and radio buttons:</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>NOTE: The bypass valve option is not yet available but under 
development.</b></font></p>

<h3>Supercharger Drive Ratio</h3>

<p>The supercharger is mechanically driven by the engine. Typically with a toothed belt and 
pulley system. The ratio between the drive pulley and the driven pulley is the "external" ratio.
Some superchargers (mostly the centrifugal type) has an internal gearbox to speed the input up 
even further. The ratio of this internal gearbox is the "internal" ratio. If there is no internal 
ratio this value is entered as "1".

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/SuperDriveRatio.jpg"></p>

<p>There is also a "Calc" button to calculate the ratio to be used. Clicking on the "Calc" button opens a sub dialog:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/SuperDriveRatioCalc.jpg"></p>

<h3>Compressor Map and Characteristics</h3>

<p>The compressor map and characteristics are generated by the <b>DigiComp</b> software which 
generates a file with the impeller dimensions and flow characteristics in a format required 
by the simulation software. To import a compressor map the button "<b>Select Compressor 
File</b>" is clicked which opens a typical file open dialog where the relevant file is selected:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/SuperSelectComp.jpg"></p>

<p>After selecting the file the dialog is updated by displaying the file name:

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/SuperCompSelected.jpg"></p>

<p>Selecting the <b>Plot</b>-button displays the map and the initial estimated match point. The next pictures  
show the typical input data and map for a centrifugal compressor followed by a Roots type example. 

<br>Note that although the supercharger rpm of the match point as displayed on the map is correct the pressure ratio 
of the match point is as prescribed by the system blow off pressure or by-pass pressure this is no guarantee 
that the engine breathing / flow resistance characteristics will actually match this point. To determine the 
actual point a simulation must be conducted.</p>
