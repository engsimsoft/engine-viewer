<title>Throttle Boundary Condition</title>

<h1>>Throttle Boundary Condition</h1>

<p>The intake systems of most internal combustion engines have a throttle somewhere in 
the system. Dat4T allows the modelling of three types of throttles in three possible
positions in the intake system. The throttle types are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Butterfly type:</b> This is the conventional throttle that uses a
         throttle plate on a spindle. At full throttle the spindle forms a restriction.
         The user has to supply the spindle diameter from which the program calculates
         the effective flow area.</li>
  <li><b>Plate Throttle:</b> The plate throttle is a plate that slides completely
         out the way with only the slot in which it slides having a slight effect on the
         flow. It is usually used with fuel injection systems on very high performance
         competition engines.</li>
  <li><b>Slide Throttle:</b> This is the typical motorcycle carburettor layout.
         It usually has a metering needle running through the centre of the bore. The
         needle, the slots the slide move in and the shape of the exposed throttle slide
         are the only factors influencing the flow.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the user has specified
the throttle type the software will automatically choose the correct Cd-map.</p>

<p>The throttles can be used in
the following three positions (note the pipe and section numbering sequence):</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>In the cylinder pipes:</b> This is the most conventional layout for high
  performance competition engines with either a carburettor or a fuel injection
  system per cylinder.

  <li><b>In the collector pipe:</b> Some engines use a collector type inlet
  manifold connected to a single carburettor.</p>

  <p align=center>
  <img width=525 height=414 src="../Pictures/ThrottleCollector.jpg"></p></li>

  <li><b>In the plenum intake pipe(s):</b> Certain engines have an intake system where
  all the cylinder pipes are connected to a small plenum with a multi-barrel
  carburettor feeding the plenum.</p>
