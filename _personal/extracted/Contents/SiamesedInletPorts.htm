<h1>Modeling Siamesed Inlet Ports</h1>
<p>Currently this capability exists only for 4 and 6 cylinder engines where the inlet 
ports of cylinder 1 is siamesed with that of cylinder 2 and the inlet port of 
cylinder 3 is siamesed with that of cylinder 4 (and 5 with 6 in an I6 engine). 
The siamesed port is modeled by firstly modeling the inlet ports on the cylinders 
very short - half the distance from the centre of the valve head to the effective 
split between the two ports. The other half of this length is modeled as part of the 
intake manifold as shown in the next figure:</p>

<h2>Basic manifold layouts</h2>
<p>There are two basic manifold layouts available:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p>A 4into2into1 manifold</li>
  <li>
  <p>Two or Three separate 2into1 manifolds</li>
</ol>

<h3>Modeling the 4into2into1 manifold</h3>
<p>In this layout the two siamesed inlet ports are joined into a 
single inlet pipe through a collector as shown in the next figure:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/insiamesedcol4t.jpg"></p>
<p>To select this version the &quot;4in2in1 manifold for siamesed inlet 
ports&quot; radio button is selected as shown on the next figure:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/4in2in1SiamInletMenu.jpg"></p>
<p>This layout can be used with:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p>&quot;no throttles&quot; which is the layout shown above</li>
  <li>
  <p>&quot;cylinder throttles&quot; which add throttles to pipe 5 and 6</li>
  <li>
  <p>&quot;collector throttle&quot; which add a throttle to pipe 7</li>
  <li>
  <p>&quot;collector box&quot; which adds an air box to the collector for all 
  three the above versions which is the &quot;Box on each atmospheric end&quot; radio 
  button selected.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Modeling the two or three 2into1 layout</h3>
<p>In this layout the two siamesed port pairs stay as separate 
inlet manifolds although they can be joined to a common box:</p>

<img border="0" src="../Pictures/in6siamesed4t.jpg"></p>
<p>To select this version the &quot;NumCyl/2 2in1 manifolds for siamesed inlet 
ports&quot; radio button is selected as shown on the next figure:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/2_2in1SiamInletMenu.jpg"></p>

<h4>Typical layouts:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p>&quot;no throttles&quot; which is the layout shown above</li>
  <li>
  <p>&quot;cylinder throttles&quot; which add throttles to pipe 5 and 6</li>
  <li>
  <p>&quot;plenum throttles&quot; which add throttles to the plenum intakes 
  but requires a &quot;common box on cylinder pipes&quot; to be selected first</li>
  <li>
  <p>common box or plenum can also be added to options 1 and 2</li>
</ol>

<h4>Using option 3 to model a typical 36DCD carburetor layout.</h4>
<p>A typical configuration this system is used to model is where a 
single twin barrel carburetor is used. The two manifolds are joined by a common 
plenum as shown in the next figure:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/insiamesedplenthrot4t.jpg"></p>
<p>To model the layout as shown the following selection was made on 
the inlet dialog and 2 air box inlets were chosen:</p>
<p align="center">

<h4>Using option 2 to model a typical 40DCOE carburetor layout</h4>
<p>A typical configuration this layout is used for is for a 
manifold that connects each port pair to a barrel of a twin choke carburetor. 
The basic layout is shown in the next figure:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/insiamesedthot4t.jpg"></p>
<p>To model this layout the following selection was made on the 
inlet dialog:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/SideDraftMenu.jpg"></p>
<p>If an air box need to be added the &quot;Common box on Cylinder 
pipes&quot; radio button is selected.</p>
