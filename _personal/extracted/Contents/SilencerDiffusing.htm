<h2><u><b>Diffusing Silencer</b></u></h2>
<p>The following two figures shows the layout of typical diffusing silencers.
The first figure shows a single plenum silencer with a re-entry inlet and a
re-entry outlet. Its internals will be modeled as two three-way branches. The
second figure shows a two-plenum silencer with the first plenum having the same
layout as in the first picture but with a plenum added. The second plenum has a
re-entry inlet but a flush outlet pipe. Its internals will be modeled as three
three-way branches and one stepped pipe. At the moment the program does not
cater for re-entry pipes that overlaps each other. The plenums does not have to
be against each other but the user has to take care in not entering physical
impossible data as the internal error checking of the software has not been
developed yet.</p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Note that in this case sum of the inlet and
outlet re-entry lengths of the interconnecting tube 1 is equal to the length of
the interconnecting tube. If the sum was smaller it would mean that plenum 1 and
plenum 2 were not against each other. If the sum was greater the model would
have no physical meaning.</font></p>
