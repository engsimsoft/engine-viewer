<h1>Types of Intake Systems</h1>

<p>There are three main general types of inlet systems available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Individual pipes per cylinder.</li>
  <li>1intoN branch manifolds where N = number of cylinders</li>
  <li>Log manifolds – all cylinders connect to a single pipe.</li>
</ul>

<p>On top of these "normal" pipes
there is a range of special pipes available depending on the engine types.</p>

<p>All the pipes can have one of two types of "atmospheric inlets":</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Plain pipe. A normal plain opening to the atmosphere.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Box pipe. The air flows from the atmosphere into a box or plenum
and from there via box outlet pipes into the intake system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The main inlet system selection dialog box</h2>

<p> When creating an inlet system for the first time or when redefining it 
the main inlet selection dialog box opens. Depending on the engine layout 
only some options will be displayed. The next picture shows all the possible 
options for all the possible engine layouts:</p>

<h2>Description of Main Intake types</h2>

<p>These are the more common types of intake
systems. They are general to any engine configuration and number
of cylinders except for the single cylinder that for obvious
reasons cannot have any sort of branch pipe.</p>

<h2>Individual Pipes</h2>

<p>This system has a pipe for each cylinder.
These pipes can each have a box or plenum attached or can be
directly open to the atmosphere. The pipes can have throttles and
boost bottles. Figure 1 shows a two-cylinder engine with
throttles, with ram tubes and box inlets.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Twin2In.jpg"></p>

<p>To select this inlet layout the following selections were made (The engine is an inline 
twin, "I2", and only the options for an I2 were available):</p>

<p align="center">

<h2>1intoN Branch Manifolds</h2>

<p>These are usually
a cheaper type of intake manifold with a single carburetor. They
are used where economy of production is the aim. The cylinder
pipes or the collector pipe can have a throttle. The collector
can be connected to a box/plenum or directly open to the
atmosphere.</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows a
typical 4into1 manifold.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../Pictures/In4in1Dialog.jpg"></p>

<h2>Double Collector Manifolds</h2>

<p>On some older inline 4 cylinder engines the inlet was often made up from two Y-collectors 
that connected two adjacent cylinders to a carburator. Some times these manifolds were 
interconnected. Both types are shown in the next figures:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../Pictures/I4-TwoYmanifoldColThrotDialog.jpg"></p>

<h2>Log Manifolds</h2>

<p>With a log manifold each cylinder is
connected to a common pipe. This is usually not found on a high
performance engine except on turbo-charged engines. This type is
still under development and will be described in detail once
development is completed. Figure 3 shows a four-cylinder engine
with a side inlet log manifold. Note the direction of flow.</p>

<h2><u>Special Manifolds</u></h2>

<h3>Discussion of Plenums</h3>

<p>A plenum or a box is modeled as a 0D element and should only be used if the 
transmission of the waves through it is not important as it only simulates emptying 
and filling with no pressure gradients through the plenum. If the phasing of the 
pressure pulses through the plenum is important the plenum should rather be modeled 
as a combination of large diameter pipes and connector points. One way to do this is 
to use the so called "Plenum-Collectors" described next:</p>

<h2><u>Plenum-Collector</u></h2>

<h3>Plenum-Collector, End Inlet, I-engine</h3>

<p>This manifold is currently  active for inline, Vee 
and Flat engines and models the typical plenum-collector as found on most fuel 
injected engines with a single throttle body at the entrance to the plenum. It 
is modelled as a series of short pipes simulating the plenum, joined to the 
cylinder pipes by collector junctions. The following picture 
is of such a manifold but the throttle body is not shown:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Edelbrock_SportCompactManifoldDim.jpg"></p>

<p>The plenum is usually too long and narrow to be modelled as a box so it is modelled 
as a log manifold with a blind pipe on the closed end and 4 3into1 junctions as shown in the next 
figure:</p>

<h2><u>Plain Plenums</u></h2>

<h3>Paired Plenum Inlets</h3>

<p>This manifold is currently only active for I2, I4, I6, I8, I10, I12 and I16 engines.</p> 

<p align="center">

<h3>Resonant Collector Box</h3>

<p>This manifold is currently only active for 4 
cylinder engines and models the system as described in US Patent 5,379,735 Jan. 10,1995. 
The idea behind the layout is to lengthen the inlet pipes by using its opposite pipe 
as part of the tuned length as shown in the next figure:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/ResonantInlet.jpg"></p>

<p>To model the two "connecting" pipes a collector is used with a 
very short collector pipe as shown in the next figure:</p>

<h2><u>Special Box or Plenum Pipes</u></h2>

<p>There are two special Box pipes depending on the engine layout:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Single Box. A single common box on all the inlet pipes to the cylinders.</li>
  <li> Double Box. Two boxes, usually on a V or flat engine, with one box per bank.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to keep in mind that these boxes or plenums should only be used where 
the wave action in the plenum does not play a major role and missing it will not influence 
the characteristics being investigated with the simulation. If this is not the case a 
Plenum-Collector should rather be used.</p>

<h3>One common box on a multi-cylinder engine with individual
cylinder pipes (Single Plane Manifold), also used to model a 
<font size="4" color="red">V8 Tunnel Ram</font> or Single Plane manifold</h3>

<p>All the cylinder pipes go directly into a
common box. The box can have multiple inlet pipes. A typical
collector type inlet manifold on a V-8 with a four barrel down
draught carburetor can be modeled using this manifold with a
small plenum volume.</p>
