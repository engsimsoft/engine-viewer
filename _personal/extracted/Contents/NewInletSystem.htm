<title>Creating a New Inlet System</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Creating a New Inlet System</h1>

<p>When a new inlet system is created the user choose firstly the type of manifold and then the type of
collector or inlet system. The manifold choices displayed depend on the number of cylinders and the type of
engine (inline, vee or flat). Once this choice is made the user chooses the type of inlet. Two types of 
inlets are possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open ended pipe, a plain pipe open to the atmosphere</li>
  <li>Box pipe, the pipe(s) connects to a box(es) from the atmosphere</li>
</ul>

<p>The example shown
in the following figure is a four-cylinder engine fitted with an
air box and a throttle in the collector pipe.</p>

<p>The first screen looks as follows:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../Pictures/NewIn1.jpg"></p>

<p>The choices were a collector type pipe, a box type collector, a throttle in the collector pipe, a butterfly
throttle with a 6mm spindle and no boost bottles. The atmospheric and air box pipe ends are selected as well 
as the number of air box entry pipes and box volume.</p>

<p>On the following dialog the user is starts inputting the data for each pipe:.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../Pictures/NewIn2.jpg"></p>

<p>Entering the data and selecting "Save and Display" displays the pipe:</p>

<p>Clicking the "Exit" button displays the following dialog if the pipe is the first of the cylinder pipes:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../Pictures/NewIn4.jpg"></p>

<p>If the cylinder pipes are identical 
the user clicks "Yes" and continue inputting the data for the rest of the pipes. 
If "No" each cylinder pipe's data must also be entered. After the data for all 
the pipes have been entered the dialog for the collector appears:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../Pictures/NewIn5.jpg"></p>

<p>The user can now enter the angle for each pipe pair for a non-symmetrical collector or select the 
axisymetric radio button and only enters the outflow pipe angle with the collector centre line after 
which the program calculates all the angles:</p>

<p>At this point the  system is fully specified but can be further modified or updated in the Edit dialog.</p>
