<title>Inlet Pipe Numbering Convention</title>

<h1>Inlet Pipe Numbering Convention</h1>

<p>Before the numbering convention is discussed it is
necessary to first define what is meant by a pipe:</p>

<p>A Pipe is a piece of tube that runs from one boundary to
the next with no discontinuities in between.</p>

<h2>Boundaries:</h2>

<ul>
 <li>End of a pipe at the cylinder manifold face.</li>
 <li>Start of a pipe open to the atmosphere.</li>
 <li>A collector (multi-pipe joint).</li>
 <li>The entry to or exit from a box or plenum.</li>
 <li>The entry to or exit from a throttle.</li>
 <li>The entry to or exit from a compressor.</li>
 <li>The entry to or exit from an intercooler.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: A straight pipe connected to a gradual area change
(diffuser) is not a boundary but just one pipe with 2 sections.</p>

<h2>Pipe Numbering</h2>

<p>Pipes are numbered in the <b>opposite </b>direction of
major flow starting at the cylinders and in cylinder sequence. Using this
sequence the pipes connecting to the cylinder pipes are numbered next and this
process is continued until the last pipe open to the atmosphere is numbered.
This is demonstrated in the following example:</p>

<h3>Example 1: Demonstration of Pipe numbering process</h3>

<p>This example shows the layout and pipe numbering for a four-cylinder
engine fitted with a 4into1 pipe system fitted with a box. Each cylinder pipe
has one throttle in it and the box has 3 inlet pipes. The numbering is shown in
the following figure (also take note of what each pipe is called):</p>

<p>The pipes connecting directly to the cylinder head (called
cylinder pipes) are numbered first, followed by the throttle body pipes (the
pipes leading up to the throttles), then the collector pipe followed by the box
inlet pipes.</p>

<p>The exception to this rule is when a boost bottle is
employed. The pipes on an engine with boost bottles are numbered from the
cylinder head until a collector, an open end or a box/plenum is encountered and
then the boost bottle pipes are numbered before the collector or box inlet
pipes. This is illustrated in the next example:</p>

<h3>Example 2: Numbering with a boost bottle in the system</h3>

<p>Note how the pipes are numbered from the cylinder up to
the atmospheric inlet and only then the boost bottle pipe is numbered.</p>

<h2>Pipe Section Numbering</h2>

<p>Pipes with gradual area changes are subdivided into sections.
These sections are also numbered in the major direction of flow. A pipe can
have no less than 1 section and a maximum of 12 sections. To identify which
pipe a section belongs to a section is numbered using a double index system,
the first index identifies the pipe it belongs to and the second index is the
section number. For example, <b>section(2,3)</b> means section 3 in pipe 2.
This is demonstrated in the following two examples:</p>

<h3>Example 3: Pipe section numbering on a single cylinder engine</h3>

<p>A single cylinder engine fitted with a bell mouth and
throttle system is shown. The throttle body is fitted with a small cone, the
bell mouth or velocity stack. To model this engine one uses two inlet pipes
with the throttle body pipe, pipe 2, divided into three sections, a tapered
pipe, a parallel pipe and another tapered pipe. </p>

<p align=center><img src="../Pictures/InThrot1.jpg"></p>

<p>The first tapered pipe, pipe2 section 1, simulates the
bell mouth. The second tapered pipe, pipe2 section 3, simulates the venturi.
The pipe connecting the venturi to the cylinder head, pipe 1, is modelled here
as a gradually tapering pipe. </p>

<p>Note how the pipes are numbered starting from the cylinder
head interface to the atmospheric entry while the sections in each pipe are
numbered in the direction of the flow.</p>

<p>The user is free to model each pipe with as many sections
as required (with a maximum of 12 per pipe); this layout is just one
possibility for an intake with a throttle and a venturi. It is the
responsibility of the user to model the real situation as close as possible to
ensure accurate results.</p>

<h3>Example 4: Pipe section numbering on a multi-cylinder engine</h3>

<p>This example shows the same basic pipe configuration as
used in Example 1 but with the throttles replaced with short tapered sections.
This results in a reduction in the number of pipes. Notice how the pipes are
numbered against the flow direction but the sections in the direction of flow.</p>

<h2>Section Diameter Numbering Convention</h2>

<p>A section has only one length but it has two diameters;
the starting diameter and the finishing diameter. For a parallel pipe the two
diameters are the same but for a taper pipe they are not. The first diameter of
a pipe is numbered as 0. After that each diameter has the number of the section
leading up to it. This means that the starting diameter of a section, other
than the first section, will have the number of the previous section. This is
shown in the next example.</p>

<h3>Example 5: Pipe section diameter numbering</h3>

<p>A similar pipe as in Example 3 is used but with the diameter numbers added.</p>
