<h2><u>Creation of a user defined exhaust port Cd-map based on Flowbench Data</u></h2>

<p>The software uses <a HREF="../Cd-Maps/Cd-Map.htm">Cd-maps</a> for the port flows based on measured data for 
typical head and valve configurations. Sometimes it is necessary for the user to 
modify these maps based on data obtained on a flowbench. To do this, the user selects 
the &quot;<b>User Defined from Flowbench Data</b>&quot; radio button on the cam and inlet port dialog:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/ExCd-MapRadio.jpg"></p>
<p>Which then changes to show the following dialog:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/ExCd-mapDialog.jpg"></p>

<p>The next step is to either select or create new flow bench and 
Cd-map files by clicking first the &quot;<b>New Flow Bench File</b>&quot; button and selecting a file 
name and then the &quot;<b>New Cd-map File</b>&quot; button to create or select the Cd-map file:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/ExCd-mapFiles.jpg"></p>

<p>Next we click on the &quot;<b>Calculate Cd-Map</b>&quot; button and the following 
dialog opens if it is a new file that already exists:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Cd-MapFlowBenchEmpty.jpg"></p>

<p>Click on the &quot;<b>OK</b>&quot; button to open the following dialog:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Cd-MapBenchDialogBlank.jpg"></p>

<p>The user has to complete the form before continuing:</p>
<h3><b><u>Lift Units</u></b></h3>
<p>The user has to select the units in which the valve lift on the flowbench was measured.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>m</b> - meter (Typical values: 0.006 to 0.025).</li>

</ul>

<h3><b><u>Flowbench Test Pressure Units</u></b></h3>
<p>This is the delta pressure measured over the flowbench orifice. It usually is between 10" and 28" of 
H2O (Water) on most commercial flowbenches.</p>
<p>The user has to select the units in which the flowbench pressure was recorded.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>bar</b> - bar (Typical values: 0.020 to 0.162, nominal: 0.075).</li>

  <li><b>atm</b> - atmosperic pressure (Typical values: 0.020 to 0.160, nominal: 0.074).</li>
</ul>

<h3><b><u>Flow Units</u></b></h3>
<p>The user has to select the units in which the volume flow on the flowbench was recorded.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>m^3/s</b> - Cubic meter per second (Typical values: 0 to 0.472).</li>
  <li><b>m^3/min</b> - Cubic meter per minute (Typical values: 0 to 28.31).</li>
  <li><b>m^3/h</b> - Cubic meter per hour (Typical values: 0 to 1699).</li>
  <li><b>cfs</b> - Cubic feet per second (Typical values: 0 to 16.67).</li>
  <li><b>cfm</b> - Cubic feet per minute (Typical values: 0 to 1000).</li>

</ul>

<h3><b><u>Ambient Temperature Value</u></b></h3>
<p>The ambient temperature value as recorded during the flow testing must be entered in the units as selected.</p>

<h3><b><u>Ambient Pressure Value</u></b></h3>
<p>The ambient pressure value as recorded during the flow testing must be entered in the units as selected.</p>

<h3><b><u>Flowbench Test Pressure Value</u></b></h3>
<p>The flowbench pressure setting value as recorded during the flow testing must be entered in the units as selected.</p>

<h3><b><u>Starting Map</u></b></h3>
<p>As a flowbench records data only at one pressure ratio and a Cd-map covers a range of pressure ratios 
the Cd-map creation methodology is to use an existing map as starting point and then use the flowbench data at one of these 
pressure ratios to calculate correction factors which is then applied to the selected base map. The user has to select this base 
map based on his experience with the engine.</p>
<h3><b><u>Flowbench Data</u></b></h3>
<p>The flowbench data is now filled in:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/ExCd-MapBenchDialogFilled.jpg"></p>

<p></p>
<h3><b><u>Display Flow Curve</u></b></h3>
<p>Selecting the &quot;<b>Display Flow Curve</b>&quot; button calculates the corrected 
<a HREF="../Cd-Maps/Cd-Map.htm">Cd-values</a> for the flow bench pressure ratio and displays it (Cda) and  
the theoretical Cd-values (Cdi) on a graph. This is used to verify that the input data is correct and does 
not result in Cd values greater than 1.0. Selecting the &quot;<b>Continue</b>&quot; button returns 
to the Flowbench dialog.</p>

<h3><b><u>Calculate Cd-Map and save Flowbench File and Cd-Map</u></b></h3>

<p>Select the &quot;<b>Calculate Cd-Map and save Flowbench File and Cd-Map</b>&quot; button which  
also calculates the corrected Cd value and displays it but then on &quot;<b>Continue</b>&quot; it updates and 
saves the Cd-map and the flowbench input file, then it returns to the inlet port dialog.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/ExCd-Curve.jpg"></p>

<p>The software will automatically calculate the corrections from 
the chosen Cd-map to be used as the base map and when running the simulation the 
new Cd-map will be used.</p>

<h3><b><u>Exit without saving</u></b></h3>
<p>Quits the Cd-Map dialog box without calculating a Cd-map or saving the flowbench input file.</p>

<h3><b><u>Error Message</u></b></h3>
<p>Sometimes the following error message will be displayed:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Cd-Error.jpg"></p>
<p>This error message means that for the specified values of the port and 
the test conditions the calculated mass flow is more than what is physically possible. 
The following is an indication of the possible error:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Test bench test pressure was higher than the recorded pressure.</li>
  <li>The ambient pressure was lower than the recorded pressure.</li>
  <li>The ambient temperature was higher than the recorded temperature.</li>
  <li>The recorded flow was higher than the actual flow.</li>
  <li>The recorded valve lift was lower than the actual valve lift.</li>
  <li>The recorded port or valve size is smaller than the actual size.</li>
  <li>The included valve seat angle is smaller than the actual one.</li>
</ul>
