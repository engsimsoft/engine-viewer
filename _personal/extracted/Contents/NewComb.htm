<title>Creating a new Spark Ignition Combustion Subsystem</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Creating a new Spark Ignition Combustion Subsystem</h1>

<p>There are three types of combustion models
available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prescribed Burn Rate - using a Vibe function</li>
  <li>Prescribed Burn Rate - using a Adjusting Vibe function</li>
  <li>Calculated Burn Rate - using a turbulent entrainment model</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prescribed Burn Rate Model (Vibe Function)</h2>
<p>It uses a Vibe curve fitted to the mass fraction
burnt as a function of combustion duration in degrees. The values for the Vibe
function have to be supplied by the user. There are three ways of
obtaining the values for the Vibe function:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Measured values. This is obtained from a measured pressure traces of the
    combustion period. </li>
  <li>Simulated results. pUsing full 3-dimensional
    Computational Fluid Dynamic software to model the combustion.</li>
  <li>Average values. In <a href="../Contents/References.htm">Blair’s</a> book is a range
    of tested values for typical engines. It is the best way to obtain
    reasonable values.</li>
</ul>

<p>The user has to prescribe the Vibe
coefficients, A and M, to describe the Vibe curve. Refer to Blair’s book for a more detailed description.
 The user also has to prescribe the Delay period and the Duration period of the
combustion process.</p>

<h2>Corrected Burn Rate Model (Vibe Function)</h2>
<p>It uses a Vibe curve fitted to the mass fraction
burnt as a function of combustion duration in degrees. The values for the starting Vibe
function have to be supplied by the user. After three iteration cycles the model corrects
the Vibe values after every cycle using special functions as described by Bonatesta,
refer to <a href="../Contents/References.htm">reference 4.</a></p>

<h2>Calculated Burn Rate Model (Turbulent Entrainment)</h2>
<p>This model is based on the classical turbulent
entrainment model first proposed by Blizard and Keck, SAE730000. It uses the
turbulent intensity in the cylinder to calculate the rate at which unburnt gas
is entrained in the flame front. The turbulent intensity is calculated from the
transfer flow, with losses through the exhaust port and is enhanced by the
piston movement and squish flow. The current model does not yet take spark
strength into consideration during the delay period calculations.</p>

<h2>Creating a New Combustion Model</h2>
<p>The following dialog will appear 
when creating a new combustion subsystem:</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/NewCombustion.jpg"></p>

<p align="left">The
user selects the type of combustion model by selecting one of the radio buttons
in the group box labelled: <b>Combustion Model</b>. Selecting the <b>Burn Rate
Prescribed</b> radio button selects the Vibe function based model. Selecting the
<b>Turbulent Entrainment</b> radio button selects the turbulent combustion
model. <b><font color="#FF0000">Even though this model calculates its own delay
and duration periods and combustion rates, the user must still prescribe them
using realistic values to allow toggling between the two types of models.</font></b></p>

<h3><u>Fuel Type</u></h3>
<p>The current version of the software allows a choice of 10
different type of fuels for spark ignition engines:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Regular</li>
  <li>Premium</li>
  <li>Unleaded 95</li>
  <li>Unleaded 100</li>
  <li>Aviation Gasoline (AV-Gas)</li>
  <li>Methanol</li>
  <li>Ethanol</li>
  <li>Leaded Racing 110</li>
  <li>Propane and Butane mix. Selecting this fuel will open the 
    following edit box:
    <p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="../Pictures/Propane.jpg"></p></li>
  <li>Unleaded and Ethanol mix (E85 is 85% ethanol). Selecting this fuel will open the 
    following edit box:
    <p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="../Pictures/E85.jpg"></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Depending on 
the chosen fuel the stochiometric AFR will appear in the edit box. Depending on
the AFR, the mixture purity and the cylinder pressure and temperature the
laminar burn rate for the chosen fuel will be calculated during turbulent
combustion.</p>
<p>By choosing a fuel the software provides
the latent heat of evaporation, lower calorific value and the carbon and
hydrogen ratios.</p>

<h3><u>Nitro-Methane Ratio</u></h3>
<p>The effect of nitro-methane can be simulated by
choosing a Nitro to Fuel ratio larger than 0.</p>

<h3><u>Number of Rows in the Combustion Map</u></h3>
<p>The combustion map consists of between 1 and 15 
rows of data. The software interpolates between these rows during a simulation. 
If the simulated rpm value falls outside the map the closest map point data is 
used.</p>

<h3><u>RPM</u></h3>
<p>This is the points at which the combustion model values
are supplied. If measured values are available there will be a range of rpm
values used. If the values from Blair’s book are used there will typically be
only one point. The software interpolates between these values if a simulation
is requested that does not correspond to one of the values. If the requested
simulation is lower than the minimum value supplied, it will use this minimum
value and not extrapolate. The same goes for the case where the requested
simulation is at higher a higher value than supplied, it will then use the
highest supplied value. In the case where only one value was supplied, that
value will be used for all the simulations.</p>

<h3><u>Timing</u></h3>
<p>This is the ignition timing (the point where the engine
sparks) in degrees before TDC.</p>

<h3><u>AFR (Air/fuel ratio)</u></h3>
<p>The ratio of the mass of air to the mass of fuel in the
fresh charge. A smaller number means a richer mixture. A typical value is 12.
(12kg air to 1kg fuel)</p>

<h3><u>Combustion Efficiency (Beff)</u></h3>
<p>This value takes care of all the little factors that
could not be accounted for in sub models and range between 0.85 and 0.90 for
most engines. Industrial type engines with simplistic carburettors can have a
value as low as 0.8 while sophisticated high performance engines can have a value as high as 0.95.</p>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><u>Note:</u> This value is also 
used as a calibration factor to match the engine dyno curve. A word of warning: 
When using this value to match the measured power output one must be very 
careful not to have values changing too rapidly close to one another as it is 
possible to obscure or create phenomena caused by other factors. As an example, 
if the dyno curve does not for some reason match the dips and peaks caused by 
the intake tuning and one uses Beff to force the curve to follow this, changing 
the intake length will now show a completely false picture. Use with caution!</font></b></p>

<h3><u>Delay (Combustion delay)</u></h3>
<p>The period in degrees from the spark to the start of
combustion. Typical values for the delay range from 4 degrees to 15 degrees. This 
delay period is where the small flame kernel that forms during the spark expands 
to a large enough flame to start turbulent combustion.</p>

<h3><u>Duration (Combustion duration)</u></h3>
<p>This is the period from the onset of combustion (the end
of the delay period) to the point where the combustion has been completed for
practical purposes. Values range from around 40 degrees for high performance GP
engines to as long as 80 degrees for low performance larger engines. Most engines
fall in the 45 to 55 degree range.</p>

<h3><u>Vibe A</u></h3>
<p>The first of the Vibe constants. A typical value is 6.0</p>

<h3><u>Vibe M</u></h3>
<p>The second Vibe constant. It has a typical value of 1.25.</p>
