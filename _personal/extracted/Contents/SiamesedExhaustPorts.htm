<h1>Modeling Siamesed Exhaust Ports</h1>
<p>Currently this capability exists only for 4 and 6 cylinder engines where the exhaust 
ports of cylinder 2 is siamesed with that of cylinder 3 and the inlet port of 
cylinder 1 and that of cylinder 4 is conventional. The siamesed port is modeled by 
firstly modeling the exhaust ports in the cylinder heads very short - half the distance 
from the centre of the valve head to the effective split between the two ports. 
The other half of this length is modeled as part of the exhaust manifold as shown 
in the next figure:</p>

<h2>Basic inline 4 manifold layouts</h2>
<p>There are three basic I4 manifold layouts available:</p>
<ol>
  <li>  <p>Long Center Branch - This is a 4into2into1 manifold</li>
  <li>  <p>A 3 into 1 manifold</li>
  <li>  <p>A split Center Branch</li>
</ol>

<h3>Modeling the Long Center Branch (4into2into1 manifold)</h3>
<p>In this layout the siamesed exhaust ports are joined into a 
single exhaust pipe through a collector as shown in the next figure:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex4LongCenterBranch.jpg"></p>
<p>To select this version the "4in2in1 manifold for siamesed inlet 
ports" radio button is selected as shown on the next figure:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/4in2in1SiamExhaustMenu.jpg"></p>
<p>It is also possible to model the connector pipes with blind pipe resonators:</p>

<p>To achieve this the following option is selected on the type of pipe dialog:</p>

<h3>Modeling the 3into1 layout</h3>
<p>In this layout the siamesed port center branch connects to the collector with the 
header pipes of cylinder 1 and 4:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex4-3into1Branch.jpg"></p>
<p>And with resonators:</p>
<p align="center">

<p>To select this version the "4 into 3 into 1 : 2+3 into 1 then all into 1 
- simulates 3 into 1 siamesed center port" radio button is selected as shown on the next figure:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/3in1SiamExhaustMenu.jpg"></p>

<h3>Modeling the Split Center Branch (4into3into4into2into1 manifold)</h3>
<p>In this manifold the center branch is split into two pipes which joins headers 1 and 4 
which then joins into the collector pipe.</p>

<p>To select this version the "Split Center Branch on Siamesed Exhaust port on 
cylinder 2 and 3" radio button is selected as shown on the next figure:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/SplitCenterBranchSiamExhaustMenu.jpg"></p>

<h2>Basic inline 6 manifold layouts</h2>
<p>There is currently one basic I6 manifold layout available:</p>
<ol>
  <li>  <p>A 4 into 1 manifold</li>
</ol>

<h3>Modeling the 4into1 layout</h3>
<p>In this layout the two siamesed port sets connects to the collector with the 
header pipes of cylinder 1 and 6:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex6Siamesed-Collector4T.jpg"></p>

<p>To select this version the "6 into 4 into 1 to model two center siamesed exhaust ports" radio button is selected as shown on the next figure:</p>
