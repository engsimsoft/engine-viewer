<h1>Creating a New Exhaust System</h1>

<p>When a new exhaust system is created the
user choose firstly the type of manifold and then the type of collector or outlet system. The
manifold choices displayed depend on the number of cylinders and the type of engine
(inline, vee or flat). Once this choice is made the user chooses the type of
outlet. Three types of outlets are possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open ended pipe a plain pipe open to the atmosphere</li>
  <li>Box pipe the pipe(s) connects to a box(es) and from there to the atmosphere</li>
  <li>Silencer type the outlet pipe(s) is fitted with a silencer.</li>
</ul>

<p>The example shown in the following
figures is a four-cylinder engine fitted with a box in the collector pipe. It
has one step per header and one step per collector pipe. The box has two outlet
pipes.</p>

<p>The first screen looks as follows where we choose the "N into 1" manifold:</p>

<p align=center><img src="../Pictures/new_Ex1.jpg"></p>

<p>On the following screen the user is asked for the type of pipe end to the atmosphere and by 
choosing a <b>"Box on each atmospheric outlet pipe"</b> the entrance to and exit from the exhaust 
box and the atmospheric outlet edge conditions has to be selected as well as the number of box 
outlet pipes and box volume. The number of steps in the header pipes and collector pipe can also 
be selected.</p>

<p align=center><img src="../Pictures/new_Ex2.jpg"></p>

<p>The next screen asks the number of sections in header pipe 1 and then the start and end 
diameters and length of each section must be filled in.</p>

<p align=center><img src="../Pictures/new_Ex3.jpg"></p>

<p>Click on "Save and Display" and the pipe is shown graphically:</p>

<p align=center><img src="../Pictures/new_Ex4.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is followed by the question whether the 
primary headers (the headers connected to the cylinder head) are identical or 
not. If the headers are the same length and diameter this shortcut saves the 
time to input the data for each header individually. In this case they are 
identical.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../Pictures/new_Ex5.jpg"></p>

<p>Because there is one step per header the
number of sections their lengths and diameters in the secondary headers, (the headers following the first
step) are required. Following the same procedure the same shortcut for identical secondary headers are
available.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../Pictures/new_Ex8.jpg"></p>

<p>The collector pipe has one step in it resulting in two pipes. The user is asked for the number of 
sections and their lengths and diameters in each pipe. The first pipe has an extra button available: 
<b>"Recommended Starting Diameter for Collector Pipe"</b>. This button uses the angle between the 
header pipes and the collector center line to calculate the effective area of the four angled pipes 
and assign this to the start of the collector as an option the user can select or discard to use his 
own dimension.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../Pictures/new_Ex9.jpg"></p>

<p>Clicking on this button opens the following dialog box:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../Pictures/new_Ex9A.jpg"></p>

<p>We enter a value for the angle of 10, click <b>"Calculate"</b> and then click on <b>"Accept"</b> and 
then enter the rest of the collector data before the first step:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../Pictures/new_Ex10.jpg"></p>

<p>After entering the data we click on <b>"Save and Display"</b> and the first stage of the collector 
is displayed:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../Pictures/new_Ex11.jpg"></p>

<p>Next we enter and display the data for the part of the collector pipe after the step:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../Pictures/new_Ex12.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../Pictures/new_Ex13.jpg"></p>

<p>Following this the user is asked for the number 
of sections and their lengths and diameters in each box outlet pipe.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../Pictures/new_Ex14.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../Pictures/new_Ex15.jpg"></p>

<p>Once all the geometric data is supplied the
user is prompted for the angles between the pipes entering the collector. The
software automatically indexes the pipes but it is up to the user to identify
which pipe is which.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../Pictures/new_Ex16.jpg"></p>

<p>The user can supply the angle 
for each pipe pair as requested or if the collector is symmetrical only the 
angle between the outflow pipe centreline and the centreline of one of the 
inflow pipes need to be supplied and the software will calculate the rest as 
shown in the next dialog box:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../Pictures/new_Ex17.jpg"></p>

<p>The pipe is now completely modeled. If further changes needs to be made the pipe data can be 
accessed through the edit button on the main subsystem edit dialog by clicking on the 
<b>"Edit Exhaust Type and Data"</b> button which opens the following dialog box:</p>
