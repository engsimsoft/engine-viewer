<h2><u><b>Introduction to Silencers</b></u></h2>
<p><font size="3">The silencer models included in the software are there purely
to allow the correct gasdynamics to be predicted in the pipes. At a much later
stage the noise emissions will be predicted. The silencer models are not yet
fully debugged and will mostly only work on single cylinder engines or pipes
with a single outlet but not on all. It is recommended that <a HREF="References.htm">chapter 7 of
reference 1</a> be read first.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#FF0000"><u><b>The silencers in the current version is
used at the users own risk.</b></u></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="3">Before the silencer models can be described it
is first necessary to briefly describe two sub-models.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="4"><u><b>1. Butted Joints</b></u></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="3">Butted joints or flush entry or exit of a pipe
is the case where a pipe enters or exits a silencer and stops or starts flush
with the wall. If the main silencer is modeled as a pipe the butted joint is
nothing more than a stepped pipe as described in Stepped pipes. The basics are
repeated in the next figure. If the main silencer is modeled as a plenum the
entry or exit type has no influence.</font></p>

<p align="left"><u><b><font color="#000000" size="4">2. Re-entry Pipes</font></b></u></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3">Re-entry pipes are a common occurrence
in industrial type silencers. Basically the pipe entering or exiting the
silencer protrudes past the silencer wall as shown in the next figure. If the
main silencer is modeled as a plenum this has no effect but if the main silencer
is modeled as a tube (to correctly account for the wave action) the end of the
pipe is modeled as a three way branch as shown in the figure. The software will
automatically calculate the pipe lengths and diameters and branch angles from
the user input data.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3">Including a silencer in the
simulation dramatically slows down the simulation so must be avoided if
possible. The following screen shows the possible options currently available.</font></p>
