 <h2>Modeling Variable Valve Timing (VVT) and Variable Valve Lift (VVL)</h2>
  
 <p>The software can model variable valve lift combined with variable valve timing. This can be achieved using two 
 methods where one allows the movement from one lift curve and timing to a second lift curve and timing, and the other 
 allows one curve with variable timing and then at a specific rpm value changes over to a second curve also with 
 variable timing.</p>
 
 <ul>
	<li>The first is achieved by specifying two valve lift profiles, each with its own lift, duration and timing and 
	the rpm value up to which profile 1 is used and the rpm value from which profile 2 is used. The simulation will 
	use linear interpolation for timing and lift between the two rpm values.</li>

	<li>The second is achieved by specifying two valve lift profiles, each with its own lift, duration and timing as 
	a function of the rpm value. The change over rpm is also specified. The simulation will 
	use linear interpolation for the timing of each cam between the two rpm values.</li>
 </ul>

 <p>Both methods of lift profile specification, generated and imported can be used for specifying the start and end 
 lift profile but only one method at a time per port. This means that as an example the generated profiles can be 
 used for the exhaust port and an imported profile for the inlet. It is also possible to have only one port with 
 VVT/L. In the rest of the discussion the one method will be used for the exhaust port an the other method for the 
 inlet port.</p>

 <h2>Using a Generated Lift Profile</h2>

 <h3>Selecting VVT&L and specifying RPM range</h3>

 <p>By selecting the <b>Variable Valve Timing (VVT) and/or Lift (VVL)</b> radio button additional input boxes opens. 
 The first set requires the control rpm values. The first value is the rpm value up to which the lift profile 1 is 
 used. The second value is the rpm value from where the second lift profile is used.</p>

 <p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/VVT-RPM-Ex.jpg" width="360" height="323"></p>

 <p>If a step change is required specify the second value as 1 rpm more for example rpm1 = 6000 and 
 rpm2 = 6001.</p>

 <p>The next figure shows the data required for the two lift profiles to be generated:</p>

 <p>After the data has been entered and the <b>Accept and Save</b> button was clicked the graphics plus timing 
 data for Lift Profile 1 is diaplayed:</p>

 <p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/VVT-Gen-Cam1.jpg" width="919" height="697"></p>

 <p>Clicking the <b>OK</b> button displays the graphics and timing data for Lift Profile 2:</p>

 <p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/VVT-Gen-Cam2.jpg" width="919" height="697"></p>

 <h2>Using an Imported Lift Profile</h2>

 <h3>Selecting VVT&L and specifying RPM range</h3>

 <p>By selecting the <b>Variable Valve Timing (VVT) and/or Lift (VVL)</b> radio button additional input boxes opens. 
 The first set requires the control rpm values. The first value is the rpm value up to which the lift profile 1 is 
 used. The second value is the rpm value from where the second lift profile is used.</p>

 <p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/VVT-RPM-In.jpg" width="392" height="324"></p>

 <p>If a step change is required specify the second value as 1 rpm more for example rpm1 = 6000 and 
 rpm2 = 6001.</p>

 <h3>Selecting Variable Valve Timing and Lift</h3>

 <p>By selecting the <b>Variable Valve Timing and Lift (VVT and VVL)</b> radio button additional input boxes opens.</p>

 <ul>
	<li>The first set requires the control rpm and timing values for lift profile 1. The first value is the rpm value up to 
        which the lift profile 1 first timing value is used and the timing value. The second value is the rpm value from 
        where the second timing value is used.</li>
	<li>The second set requires the control rpm and timing values for lift profile 2. The first value is the rpm value up to 
         which the lift profile 2 first timing value is used and the timing value. The second value is the rpm value from 
         where the second timing value is used.</li>
	<li>The rpm value where the lift changes from profile 1 to profile 2 is also supplied</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>Importing the two Lift Profiles</h3>

 <p>The next figure shows the data required for the two lift profiles to be imported. Note that only one 
 method of specifying the timing for both profiles can be used.</p>

 <p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/VVT-Imp-In.jpg" width="332" height="497"></p>

 <p>After the data has been entered and the <b>Accept and Save</b> button was clicked the graphics plus timing 
 data for Lift Profile 1 is diaplayed:</p>

 <p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/VVT-Imp-Cam1.jpg" width="919" height="697"></p>

 <p>Clicking the <b>OK</b> button displays the graphics and timing data for Lift Profile 2:</p>

 <p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/VVT-Imp-Cam2.jpg" width="919" height="697"></p>

 <p>After saving the inlet and exhaust port, valve and lift profile data the combination can be seen by clicking 
 on the <a href="STA.htm">"<b>STA</b>"</a> button:
