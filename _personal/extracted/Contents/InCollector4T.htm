<title>Collector Modelling</title>

<h1>Collector Modeling</h1>

<p>The pipe boundary where 3 or more pipes join is known as a collector. Normally an inlet 
collector has one incoming pipe and a number of outgoing pipes. The incoming pipe, depending 
on its position in the inlet system is known as the connector pipe or the collector pipe. 
When modeling a collector junction there are two values of importance:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Relative pipe angles</li>
  <li>Collector area (diameter)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Pipe angles</h3>

<p>The angles between the pipes are used to determine the loss factors in the simulation. 
If two pipes enter the collector parallel (zero included angle) and at some stage the gas 
flows from the one into the other one (making a u-turn) larger flow losses will occur 
compared to the case where they are at a much larger angle to each other. The smallest 
angle that can be used is 0° and the largest angle is 180°.</p>

<p>During the creation of a pipe system the software will query the user for the included 
angles between the pipes. It is up to the user to ensure that he understands the pipe 
numbering convention to be able to supply the correct angles.</p>

<p>If the pipes exiting the collector are arranged to make the same angle with the 
center line of the incoming pipe (a symmetrical collector junction) it is possible to 
generate the angles by just supplying the angle between the center line of the incoming 
pipe and the outgoing pipes:</p>

<h3>Collector Areas</h3>

<p>When modelling the collector pipe it is
usual practice to model the first area as the sum total of the areas of the outgoing
pipes. (As the software uses diameters this area must be converted to an effective
diameter.) This is the position marked on the Figures as <b>Collector</b>. From this
point upstream, the next area (diameter) will depend on the type of collector. In the merge
collector this area is the same as the collector area.</p>

<h2>Standard Collector Types</h2>

<p>There are typically three standard types of collectors and one special type. They are 
described here with guidelines to model them. </p>

the user to decide what type of collector is being modelled and where in the 
pipe junction the collector boundary is.</b></font></p>

<h3><b>1. Y Collector</b></h3>

<p>This is a more economic collector and is
formed by deforming a piece of tube or by fabricating it from a piece of plate. The
incoming pipes are usually parallel (zero included angle) but they might be at a slight
angle to each other. This fabricated piece usually tapers down to section 2 of the
collector pipe, from there they are the same. Refer to Figure.</p>

<h3><b>2. Merge Collector</b></h3>

<p>This collector is the most expensive and
is usually only seen on high performance racing engines. The incoming pipes curve where
they enter the collector and has an included angle between the incoming pipes
in the region of 15° to 70° and an included angle between each incoming pipe and the
outgoing pipe of 165° to 120°. Other angles are of course possible, depending on the
fabricator of the collector. </p>

<p>For a collector with a steep angle between the incoming pipes the incoming 
pipes go directly into the collector pipe and is modelled as shown:</p>

<h3><b>3. T-collectors</b></h3>

<h4>Merge Type - big angles but similar sized pipes</h4>

<p>T-collectors are just a special case of a straight collector but with one or more pipes at 
a steep angle and / or with a much smaller pipe diameter, requiring the addition of a Cd-value 
to the pipe end. This is used to model a typical log manifold junction and an example is shown 
in the next figure.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../Pictures/T-collector2T.jpg"></p>

<p>This collector is basically a pipe with a side branch "T-ed" into it. Thus the angle 
between pipe 1 and pipe 3 is 180° (it is a straight pipe). The angle between pipe 1 and pipe 2 is 
usually somewhere between 60° and 90°. Typical angle sizes are as follows and the pipe ends 
that are forming the collector junction all blend into each other so the <b>"Blend"</b> pipe end 
configuration is selected:</p>

<p align="center">

<p>Please note that these angles are an approximation of the physical case
and should be tested by the user to simulate reality as close as possible.</p>

<h4>Sharp Type - big angles and with big differences in pipe diameters</h4>

<p>This type of junction usually have the T-pipe or T-pipes at or close to 90° to the 
major pipes in the junction. It is usually used for boost bottle junctions or for the pipes 
joining a plenum-collector manifold:</p>
