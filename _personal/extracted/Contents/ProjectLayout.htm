<h1>Project Layout</h1>

<p>Dat4T creates or edits projects for use by EngMod4T. A project
consists of a collection of subsystems that are stored in individual files. A main project
file contains the list of subsystem files. The name of this project file is the name of
the engine to be simulated. A project consists of the following:</p>

<h2>Project File (ProjectName.pjt)</h2>

<p>This file contains a list of all the
subsystem file names. When a new project is created Dat4T automatically 
creates subsystem files with the project name. The user can then use these 
names or change them to existing subsystem names. If the new names 
are used they will be empty subsystems that has to be populated by the user.</p>

<h3>Engine Subsystem (EngineName.eng)</h3>

<p>The engine subsystem describes the basic engine layout and
geometry. It also contains some starting values and control values for the main
simulation.</p>

<h3>Exhaust Cam, Port and Valve Subsystem (ExhaustPortName.exp)</h3>

<p>This contains all the data for the exhaust cam, the port
dimensions, the flow conditions and the number and dimensions of the valves. </p>

<h3>Inlet Cam, Port and Valve Subsystem (InletPortName.ipo)</h3>

<p>This contains all the data for the inlet cam, the port dimensions,
the flow conditions and the number and dimensions of the valves.</p>

<h3>Exhaust Subsystem </u>(ExhaustName.exl, ExhaustName.exd)</h3>

<p>These files contain all the relevant information to describe the
type and layout of the exhaust system. The first file describes the type of system, sets
up the atmospheric and plenum connectivity, specifies the collector angles and plenum
volumes and gives the length dimensions of all the pipes.</p>

<p>The second file contains all the pipe diameters.</p>

<h3>Intake Subsystem </u>(IntakeName.inl, IntakeName.ind)</h3>

<p>These files contain all the relevant information to describe the
type and layout of the intake system. The first file describes the type of system, sets up
the atmospheric and plenum connectivity, specifies the collector angles, plenum volumes
and throttle type and dimensions and gives the length dimensions of all the pipes.</p>

<p>The second file contains all the pipe diameters.</p>

<h3>Combustion and Ignition Subsystem </u>(CombustionName.cbd)</h3>

<p>This subsystem describes the combustion model and parameters,
specifies the type of fuel and the combustion efficiency and contains generic combustion
chamber details.</p>

<h3>Temperature and Atmospheric Subsystem (TemperatureName.tmp)</h3>

<p>This subsystem prescribes the wall surface temperatures 
of the combustion chamber and all the ducts as well as the atmospheric 
temperature and pressure.</p>

<h3>Turbocharger and Boost Control Subsystem (TurbochargerName.trb)</h3>

<p>This subsystem defines the turbocharger installation layout, the type of 
boost control and gives the names of the compressor and turbine maps.</p>

<h2>Additional Files</h2>

<p>A project contains additional files, some are currently being used
and others are meant for use with future upgrades of the software.</p>

<p><b>ExhaustName.sil </b>Currently used to contain the exhaust
silencer data. The silencer subsystem is still undergoing development and is only
partially active.</p>

<p><b>ExhaustPortName.exc </b>This file is being used to contain the
exhaust valve lift profile in the format as used by EngMod4T</p>

<p><b>IntakePortName.inc </b>This file is being used to contain the
intake valve lift profile in the format as used by EngMod4T</p>

<p><b>ProjectName.prt </b>This file gives a printable summary all the
subsystems as contained in the project file. </p>
