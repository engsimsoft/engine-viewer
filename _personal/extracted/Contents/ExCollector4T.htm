<title>Collector Modelling</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Collector Modeling</h1>

<p>The pipe boundary where
3 or more pipes join is known as a collector. Normally an exhaust collector has a number
of incoming pipes and one outgoing pipe. The outgoing pipe, depending on its position in
the exhaust system is known as the connector pipe or the collector pipe. When modeling a
collector there are two values of importance:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Relative pipe angles</li>
  <li>Collector area (diameter)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Pipe angles</h3>

<p>The angles between the pipes are used to determine the loss factors in the simulation. 
If two pipes enter the collector parallel (zero included angle) and at some stage the gas 
flows from the one into the other one (making a u-turn) larger flow losses will occur 
compared to the case where they are at a much larger angle to each other.</p>

<p>During the creation of a pipe system the software will query the user for the included 
angles between the pipes. It is up to the user to ensure that he understands the pipe 
numbering convention to be able to supply the correct angles.</p>

<p>If the pipes going into the collector are arranged to make the same angle with the 
center line of the out going pipe (a symmetrical collector junction) it is possible to 
generate the angles by just supplying the engle between the incoming pipes and the 
center line of the outgoing pipe:</p>

<h3>Collector Areas</h3>

<p>When modelling the collector pipe it is
usual practice to model the first area as the sum total of the areas of the incoming
pipes. (As the software uses diameters this area must be converted to an effective
diameter.) This is the position marked on the Figures as <b>Collector</b>. From this
point further, the next area (diameter) will depend on the type of collector. In the merge
collector this area is the same as the collector area.</p>

<h2>Standard Collector Types</h2>

<p>There are typically three standard types of collectors and one special type. They are 
described here with guidelines to model them. </p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><b>It is important to note that it is up to 
the user to decide what type of collector is being modelled and where in the 
pipe junction the collector boundary is.</b></font></p>

<h3><b>1. Y Collector</b></h3>

<h4>Steep Angle Y-collector</h4>

<p>This is a more economic collector and is
formed by deforming a piece of tube or by fabricating it from a piece of plate. The
incoming pipes are usually parallel (zero included angle) but they might be at a slight
angle to each other. This fabricated piece usually tapers down to section 2 of the
collector pipe, from there they are the same. Refer to Figure.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/CollectorTaperColAng.jpg"></p>

<h4>Zero Angle Y-Collector</h4>

<p>This is the cheapest collector and is
formed by slightly deforming the inlet of the collector pipe to follow the outside contour
of the incoming pipes. The incoming pipes are usually parallel (zero included angle) but
they might be at a slight angle to each other. Refer to Figure.</p>

<h3><b>2. Merge Collector</b></h3>

<p>This collector is the most expensive and
is usually only seen on high performance racing engines. The incoming pipes curve where
they enter the collector and has an included angle between the incoming pipes
in the region of 15 to 70 degrees and an included angle between each incoming pipe and the
outgoing pipe of 165 to 120 degrees. Other angles are of course possible, depending on the
fabricator of the collector. </p>

<h4>Steep Angle Merge Collector</h4>

<p>For a collector with a steep angle between the incoming pipes the incoming 
pipes go directly into the collector pipe and is modelled as shown:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/CollectorMergedSteepAngle.jpg"></p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/CollectorMergedSteepAngleDisplay.jpg"></p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/CollectorMergedSteepAngleColAng.jpg"></p>

<h4 align="left">Shallow Angle Merge Collector</h4>

<p>If the angle is shallower the transition from the header pipe to 
the collector pipe requires a tapered transition piece to be modelled as shown 
here:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/CollectorMergedShallowAngle.jpg"></p>

<p>The following is an example of a 4 into 1 merge collector:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/CollectorMergedShallowAngleColAng.jpg"></p>

<p>On this type of collector it is often
difficult to determine the exact position of the collector (where the incoming pipes end).
The user will have to use his judgement. From current experience it appears that the
effective collector point is at the intersection of the incoming pipe centre lines. The
effective length for the incoming pipe will thus be up to this reflection point. The
collector pipe length will start at this reflection point.</p>

<h3><b>3. T-collectors</b></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt">T-collectors are just a special case of a straight 
collector but with one pipe at a steep angle, requiring the addition of a Cd-value to the pipe end. 
This is used to model a typical log manifold junction and an example is shown in the next figure.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../Pictures/T-collector2T.jpg"></p>

<p>This collector is basically a pipe with a side branch "T-ed" into it. Thus the angle 
between pipe 1 and pipe 3 is 180deg (it is a straight pipe). The angle between pipe 1 and pipe 2 is 
usually somewhere between 60 and 90 degrees. Typical angle sizes are as follows and the pipe ends 
that are forming the collector junction all blend into each other so the <b>"Blend"</b> pipe end 
configuration is selected:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/CollectorTAngleBlend.jpg"></p>

<p>Please note that these angles are an approximation of the physical case
and should be tested by the user to simulate reality as close as possible.</p>

<h3><b>4. Internal-collectors</b></h3>

<p>An internal collector is not strictly speaking a collector but a way to model a junction where 
one pipe starts inside another pipe. Typical cases are the following examples. The first shows an 
absorption silencer:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/InternalCollector_Silencer_Diffusing.jpg"></p>

<p>Another example shows the anti-reversion unit fitted to header pipes or in the collector:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex-Anti-Reversion.jpg"></p>

<p>Note that for this configuration the end of the header pipe (pipe 1) is selected as <b>"Sharp"</b> 
and the software will apply the Cd-value of a sharp pipe entry to it when the flow is reversed. If the 
pipe has a radiused edge, selecting <b>"Round"</b> will let the software apply the Cd-value for 
a radiused edge if the flow is reversed.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/T_PipeCollect.jpg"></p>

<h3><b>5. X-collectors</b></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt">X-collectors as used in this software is an
attempt to model the collectors as used in Nascar racing. They are typically formed by
curving two pipes and then welding them together with a hole in the joining area. This is
shown in the next figure.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../Pictures/X-collector.jpg"></p>

<p align="left">This collector is modeled as an X-collector. Most of the angles are the
same as the physical angles of the collector. However, the angles between pipe 1 and 4 and
between pipe 2 and 3 is specified smaller than the actual angle in an attempt to simulate
the restriction of the connecting hole. A smaller hole will require a smaller angle.
Typical angle sizes are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1-2&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 to  45 degrees</li>
  <li>1-3&nbsp;&nbsp; 135 to 180 degrees</li>
  <li>1-4&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 to 135 degrees, 0 for a small hole and 135
    degrees for a hole size similar to the pipe diameter</li>
  <li>2-3&nbsp;&nbsp; same angle as for pipe angle 1-4</li>
  <li>2-4&nbsp;&nbsp; same angle as for pipe angle 1-3</li>
  <li>3-4&nbsp;&nbsp; same angle as for pipe angle 1-2</li>
</ul>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/Ex-XcollectorAngles.jpg"></p>

<p align="left">Please note that these angles are an approximation of the physical case
and should be tested by the user to simulate reality as close as possible.</p>
