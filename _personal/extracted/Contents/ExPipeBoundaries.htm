<title>Exhaust Pipe Nomenclature and Boundaries</title>

<h1>Exhaust Pipe Nomenclature and Boundaries</h1>
<h2 align="left">Naming Convention:</h2>
<p>To model complex exhaust systems it was necessary to adopt a naming
convention. This naming convention is described using the following figure:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/ExPipeNames4T.jpg" width="652" height="632"></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Header Pipe</b></font> - A header pipe is a pipe that 
is connected to the cylinder head. Because a header can have an abrupt area change 
(step) as in the top pipe, or a pipe junction for pipes connecting the header pipes as in 
the second pipe, it is necessary to have "<b>Primary Headers</b>" and "<b>Secondary 
Headers</b>". As there can be more steps, the next row of headers, if required, is known 
as the "<b>Tertiary Headers</b>" and so on as up to 4 steps per header pipe is allowed. 
In both figures the Primary Headers number from 1 to 4 and the Secondary Headers from 
5 to 8.</p>

<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Connector Pipe</b></font> - A "<b>Connector Pipe</b>" 
is any pipe that has multi-pipe junctions (Collectors) on both ends. There are no Connector 
Pipes in the top pipe but in the second pipe the Connector Pipes number from 9 to 15.</p>

<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Collector Pipe</b></font> - The "<b>Collector Pipe</b>"
is any pipe that is connected to only one multi-pipe junction while the other end is open to 
atmosphere, connected to a box/plenum or a silencer. It can also be divided by steps as in 
the top pipe.</p>

<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Box Pipe</b></font> - A "<b>Box Pipe</b>" is 
any pipe that leaves a box, it has a box connected to its inlet end.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="4" color='red'><b>Note:</b> Make sure the difference between a 
<b>Connector Pipe</b> and a <b>Collector Pipe</b> is clear.</font>

<h2 align="left">Boundary Description:</h2>
<p>In the exhaust system there are boundaries that are modelled by the software. 
Often these boundaries are 3-dimensional but as the software is based on 
1-dimensional gasdynamics the boundaries are modelled in a plane with special 
input values to simulate the 3-dimensional nature of the boundary. The following 
figure shows a typical exhaust system with most of the boundaries shown:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/ExBoundaries4T.jpg" width="762" height="342"></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Exhaust Valve Boundary</b></font> - This is the start of the exhaust 
system and modelled by prescribing the valve and port dimensions, selecting a Cd-map 
by selecting the amount of masking and prescribing its open and closed duration 
and area by selecting a cam profile.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Exhaust Port/Manifold Boundary</b></font> - This is typically where 
the exhaust manifold bolts to the head and can be a perfect match or there can 
be a step. A step is created by using a different diameter for the exhaust port 
manifold diameter and the diameter at the start of the header pipe. The Cd-map 
for this is automatically selected by the software depending on the area change.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b><a href="ExStepMod.htm">Exhaust Header Steps</a></b></font> - This is where there is a 
discontinuity in the header diameter that forms a step. It is formed where one 
pipe ends at a certain diameter and then continues as a pipe with a different 
diameter.&nbsp; The Cd-map for this is automatically selected by the software 
depending on the area change.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b><a href="ExCollector.htm">Exhaust Collector Boundary</a></b></font> - This is a boundary where the 
number of pipes change. In the example shown four pipes becomes one pipe. This 
is clearly a full 3-dimensional boundary. The software models the effect of the 
abrupt area changes and calculates the flow losses as a function of the angles 
between the pipes. It is important to note that it has no physical length. Any 
taper parts must be modelled as part of the collector pipe, and in rare cases, 
also as part of the header pipes.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b><a href="ExStepMod.htm">Exhaust Collector Steps</a></b></font> - This is where there is a 
discontinuity in the collector pipe diameter that forms a step. It is formed 
where one pipe ends at a certain diameter and then continues as a pipe with a 
different diameter.&nbsp; The Cd-map for this is automatically selected by the 
software depending on the area change. (It is the same as a header pipe step, it 
is just in the collector pipe)</p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b><a href="ExBoxMod.htm">Box In/Outlet Boundaries</a></b></font> - This is where a pipe starts or 
terminates in an exhaust box or plenum. During the modelling the user selects 
whether the edge is sharp or radiused and from this the software selects a Cd-map.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Atmospheric Outlet Boundary</b></font> - This is where the exhaust 
pipe connects to the atmosphere. During the modelling the user selects whether 
the edge is sharp or radiused and from this the software selects a Cd-map.</p>

and a <b>Collector Pipe</b> is clear.</font>
