<h1>Types of Intake Systems for Turbocharged and Supercharged Engines</h1>

<p>Turbocharged engines and Supercharged engines with Centrifugal compressors (blowers) can
use the same types of inlet systems although it is rare to find a dual compressor supercharger 
system. Superchargers that are of the Twin Screw (twin lobe, Roots) type cannot realistically
use all these configurations.</p>

<p>There are four main general types of inlet systems available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Individual pipes per cylinder.</li>
  <li>1intoN branch manifolds where N = number of cylinders.</li>
  <li>Log manifolds – all cylinders connect to a single pipe.</li>
  <li>Log-Plenum manifolds - where a plenum is too long and slender to be approximated with a simple plenum.</li>
</ul>

<p>On top of these normal pipes there is a range of special pipes available depending on 
the engine types.</p>

<p>All the pipes can have one of two types of atmospheric inlets:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plain pipe. A normal plain opening to the atmosphere.</li>
  <li>Box pipe. The air flows from the atmosphere into a box or plenum
and from there via box outlet pipes into the intake system.</li>
</ul>

<p>The next picture shows the dialog box with all the options. The actual options shown for the 
engine being simulated will depend firstly on the engine layout and secondly on the "Type of Inlet Manifold" and 
"Manifold Layout" options selected by the user.</p>

<h2>Description of Main Intake types</h2>

<p>These are the more common types of intake systems. They are general to any engine configuration and number
of cylinders except for the single cylinder that for obvious reasons cannot have any sort of branch pipe.</p>

<h2>Individual Pipes</h2>

<p>This system has completely separate pipes and turbo for each cylinder and is primarily used on a single 
cylinder engine.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/In-Separate-TurboIntercooler.jpg"></p>

<h2>Individual Pipes - With a Common Plenum</h2>

<p>This system has a pipe for each cylinder. These pipes end in a plenum which can be attached directly to 
the compressor or first to a charge air cooler (intercooler) and from the compressor open to the atmosphere. 
The next figures show this layout, with and without a charge air cooler.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/In4_1Box-TurboIntercooler.jpg"></p>

<p>There is also a special version that combines the intercooler outlet tank with the inlet plenum:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/In-Separate-TurboIntercoolerTankBox.jpg"></p>

<h2>1intoN Branch Manifolds</h2>

<p>All the inlet ports are connected to a single collector pipe. 
This collector pipe is connected to the turbocharger or to an intercooler first.</p>

<p>The figures show typical 4into1 manifolds with and without an intercooler.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/In4in1-TurboIntercooler.jpg"></p>

<h2>Log Manifolds</h2>

<p>With a log manifold each cylinder is
connected to a common pipe. This is usually not found on a high
performance engine except on turbo-charged engines. The next figures show a four-cylinder engine
with a log manifold with and without charge air cooler. Note the direction of flow.</p>

This example is shown with two air boxes.</p>

<h2><u>Special Manifolds</u></h2>

<h3 style="text-align:justify">Plenum-Collector</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">This manifold is currently  active for inline, Vee 
and Flat engines and models the typical plenum-collector as found on most fuel 
injected engines with a single throttle body at the entrance to the plenum. It 
is modelled as a series of short pipes simulating the plenum, joined to the 
cylinder pipes by collector junctions. The following picture 
is of such a manifold but the throttle body is not shown:</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Edelbrock_SportCompactManifoldTurboDim.jpg"></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The plenum is usually too long and narrow to be modelled as a box so it is modelled 
as a log manifold with a blind pipe on the closed end and 4 3into1 junctions as shown in the next 
figure:</p>

The next figure shows the common plenum collector on a V8 engine (4 4into1 
junctions):</p>

<p style="text-align:left">In the example shown there is also an airbox. The 
following figure shows the use of double plenum-collectors on a V8 or F8 engine, 
with individual turbochargers.</p>

<h2><u>Special Box or Plenum Pipes</u></h2>

<p>There are three special Box pipes depending on the engine layout:</p>

<h3>One common box on an inline 4 cylinder engine with the paired cylinder pipes facing each other (Resonant Manifold)</h3>

<p>This manifold is currently only active for 4 
cylinder engines and models the system as described in US Patent 5,379,735 Jan. 10,1995. 
The idea behind the layout is to lengthen the inlet pipes by using its opposite pipe 
as part of the tuned length as shown in the next figure:</p>

<p align="center">

<p>To model the two "connecting" pipes a collector is used with a 
very short collector pipe as shown in the next figure:</p>

<p>The next picture shows the options selected to create this inlet system:</p>

<h3>One common box on a multi-cylinder engine with individual cylinder pipes (Single Plane Manifold)</h3>

<p>All the cylinder pipes go directly into a common box. </p>

<h3>Two common boxes, one per bank on a Vee or Flat engine, 
with a separate turbochargers</h3>

<p>All the cylinder pipes per bank go
directly into one of the boxes. The intake to the two boxes are
separate and has separate intakes that can be fitted with a
throttles.</p>
