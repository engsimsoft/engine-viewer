<title>Creating a Compression Ignition Combustion Subsystem</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Creating a new Compression Ignition Combustion Subsystem</h1>

<p>There are two types of combustion models available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prescribed Burn Rate - using a Vibe function</li>
  <li>Calculated Burn Rate - using a turbulent entrainment model</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prescribed Burn Rate Model (Vibe Function)</h2>
<p>It uses a Vibe curve fitted to the mass fraction burnt as a function 
of combustion duration in degrees. The values for the Vibe function have 
to be supplied by the user. There are three ways of obtaining the values 
for the Vibe function:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Measured values. This is obtained from a measured pressure traces of the
    combustion period.</li>
  <li>Simulated results. Using full 3-dimensional
    Computational Fluid Dynamic software to model the combustion.</li>
  <li>Published values. In <a href="../Contents/References.htm">Blair’s</a> book is a range
    of tested values for typical engines. It is the best way to obtain
    reasonable values.</li>
</ul>

<p>The user has to prescribe the Vibe coefficients, A and M, to describe the Vibe 
curve. Refer to Blair’s book for a more detailed description. The user also has to 
prescribe the Delay period and the Duration period of the combustion process.</p>

<h2>Calculated Burn Rate Model (Turbulent Entrainment)</h2>
<p>This model is based on the classical turbulent entrainment model as proposed by 
<a href="../Contents/References.htm">Blizard and Keck, SAE740191</a>. It uses the
turbulent intensity in the cylinder to calculate the rate at which unburnt gas
is entrained in the flame front. The turbulent intensity is calculated from the
transfer flow, with losses through the exhaust port and is enhanced by the
piston movement and squish flow. The current model does not yet take the effect 
of the injection plumes on turbulence into account.</p>

<h2>Creating a New Combustion Model</h2>
<p>The following dialog will appear when creating a new combustion subsystem:</p>

<p  align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/NewCombComp.jpg"></p>

<p>The user selects the type of combustion model by selecting one of the radio buttons
in the group box labelled: <b>Combustion Model</b>. Selecting the <b>Burn Rate
Prescribed</b> radio button selects the Vibe function based model. Selecting the
<b>Turbulent Entrainment</b> radio button selects the turbulent combustion
model.</p>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Even though this model calculates its own delay
and duration periods and combustion rates, the user must still prescribe them
using realistic values to allow toggling between the two types of models and to
supply the calculation start values.</font></b></p>

<h3><u>Combustion Efficiency</u></h3>

<p>This value takes care of all the little factors that could not be accounted 
for in sub models and range between 0.85 and 0.95 for most engines.</p>

<h3><u>Fuel Temperature (°C)</u></h3>

<p>The software has to use the fuel density when calculating the mass of fuel injected 
and the density is a function of temperature.</p>

<h3><u>Number of Rows in the Combustion Map</u></h3>

<p>The combustion map consists of between 1 and 20 rows of data. The software 
interpolates between these rows during a simulation. If the simulated rpm value 
falls outside the map the closest map point data is used.</p>

<h3><u>Fuel Type</u></h3>
<p>The current version of the software allows a choice of 
5 different type of fuels for compression ignition engines:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Methanol</li>
  <li>Ethanol</li>
  <li>JP-5 (Kerosene derivitive jet fuel) </li>
  <li>JP-8 (Kerosene derivitive jet fuel)</li>
  <li>Automotive Summer Diesel</li>
</ol>

<p>Depending on the chosen fuel the stochiometric AFR will appear in the edit box. 
Depending on the AFR, the mixture purity and the cylinder pressure and temperature the
laminar burn rate for the chosen fuel will be calculated during turbulent combustion.</p>

<p>By choosing a fuel the software provides the latent heat of evaporation, lower 
calorific value, the density and the carbon and hydrogen ratios.</p>

<h3><u>RPM</u></h3>

<p>This is the points at which the combustion model values
are supplied. If measured values are available there will be a range of rpm
values used. If the values from Blair’s book are used there will typically be
only one point. The software interpolates between these values if a simulation
is requested that does not correspond to one of the values. If the requested
simulation is lower than the minimum value supplied, it will use this minimum
value and not extrapolate. The same goes for the case where the requested
simulation is at higher a higher value than supplied, it will then use the
highest supplied value. In the case where only one value was supplied, that
value will be used for all the simulations.</p>

<h3><u>Timing</u></h3>

<p>This is the start of injection timing (SOI) in degrees before TDC.</p>

<h3><u>AFR / Vol</u></h3>

<p>This field prescribes the mixture strength. The user have to choose between 
prescribing the air/fuel ratio or prescribing the volume of fuel injected in
the <b>Mixture Model</b> field:</p>

<p  align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/NewCombComp1.jpg"></p>

<h3>Air / Fuel Ratio (AFR)</h3>

<p>The ratio of the mass of air to the mass of fuel in the fresh charge. A 
smaller number means a richer mixture. A typical value is 22.(22kg air to 
1kg fuel). Using this option assumes the effect of charge loss is not taken 
into consideration.</p>

<h3>Injected Volume</h3>

<p>This is the volume of fuel injected by an injector per injection event. During 
the simulation the software will calculate the AFR for that cylinder based on the 
prescribed fuel volume injected, the density of the fuel and the mass of air trapped 
at exhaust port closure.</p>

<h3><u>Delay (Combustion delay)</u></h3>

<p>The period in degrees from the start of injection (SOI) to the start of
combustion. Typical values for the delay range from 4 degrees to 15 degrees. This 
delay period is where the small flame kernel that forms during the start of 
injection expands to a large enough flame to start turbulent combustion.</p>

<h3><u>Duration (Combustion duration)</u></h3>

<p>This is the period from the onset of combustion (the end of the delay 
period) to the point where the combustion has been completed for practical 
purposes.  Most engines fall in the 35 to 55 degree range.</p>

<h3><u>Vibe A</u></h3>

<p>The first of the Vibe constants. A typical value is 6.0</p>

<h3><u>Vibe M</u></h3>

<p>The second Vibe constant. It has a typical value of 1.25.</p>
