<h1>Creating a new Exhaust port with an Imported Cam Lift Profile</h1>

<p>This section of the help pages describes how to import an existing
valve lift file. The user will be prompted to supply the following information:</p>

<h2>Port and Valve Data</h2>

<p>This section of the input data is identical for all the valves and cams.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/ExPortLayout.jpg" width="315" height="244"></p>

<h3>Number of valves</h3>

<p>The maximum number of exhaust valves allowed is 2 and the minimum is 1.</p>

<h3>Number of Port Passages</h3>

<p>Some heads with two valves do not have siamesed ports with one outlet but two 
separate ports. The maximum number of exhaust passages allowed is 2 and the minimum
is 1. </p>

<h3>Valve Masking</h3>

<p>By choosing the amount of
valve masking (interference to the flow by the proximity of the cylinder liner), together
with the number of valves, the program will choose the relevant coefficient of discharge
maps. Currently the choices are:</p> 

<ol>
  <li>fully free flow</li>
  <li>partially masked</li>
  <li>severely masked</li>
  <li>user generated Cd-map</li>
</ol>

<h3>Cd-Map Multiplier</h3>

<p>Sometimes the engine starts off unmodified with a specific map and because it 
is modified the flow improves but not so much as to use the next map, the user 
can adjust the map to the new better flow conditions by multiplying the map by a 
factor. The maximum a map can be improved is 10% (factor = 1.1) before the next 
map should be used. The user can also start by using a better map and adjust it 
downward by up to 10% (factor = 0.9) to simulate the unmodified engine and the 
progressively adjust the map upward as the flow is improved. See also the help 
topic on <a href="PortFlowModeling.htm">Cd-maps</a>.</p>

<p>The next shows the required input data on the valve and port.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/ExValvePassage.jpg" width="323" height="328"></p>

<h3>Outer Seat Diameter on Valve</h3>

<p>The outer diameter of the valve seat area on the valve in millimetres.</p>

<h3>Inner Seat Diameter on Valve</h3>

<p>The inner diameter of the valve seat area on the valve in millimetres.</p>

<h3>Outer Seat Diameter on Head</h3>

<p>The outer diameter of the valve seat area in the head in millimetres.</p>

<h3>Inner Seat Diameter on Head</h3>

<p>The inner diameter of the valve seat area in the head in millimetres.</p>

<h3>Port Throat Diameter</h3>

<p>The diameter of the narrowest part of the port at the valve end of the port 
between the valve guide and the valve seat in millimetres. This dimension is 
usually slightly smaller than the <b>valve seat inner diameter </b>but will 
not be bigger than it.</p>

<h3>Port Diameter at Manifold</h3>

<p>The port diameter in the head at the exhaust manifold face.</p>

<h3>Valve
Stem Diameter</h3>

<p>Diameter of valve stem in millimetres. This is the diameter of the portion of the 
valve stem in the port.</p>

<h3>Valve Seat Angle</h3>

<p>The valve seat angle is half the included angle of the valve seat contact area relative 
to the valve stem center line.</p>

<h3>Length of Port Passage</h3>

<p>This is the effective or mean length of the port from the valve seat surface to 
the manifold or spigot face in millimetres.</p>

<h3>Tappet Clearance</h3>

<p>This is the tappet clearance or valve train lash in millimetres. If the imported cam 
file is measured to include the lash take-up ramp, this clearance is the actual 
clearance as used in the engine. If the start of the lift file is partially or fully up 
this ramp, the user will have to experiment with this setting to achieve the correct 
valve opening and closing points.</p>

<h2>Select Cam Control (VVT and/or VVL)</h2>

<p>The software can model variable valve lift combined with variable valve timing. This is achieved by specifying two
valve lift profiles, each with its own lift, duration and timing and the rpm value up to which profile 1 is used and 
the rpm value from which profile 2 is used. The simulation will use linear interpolation for timing and lift between 
the two rpm values. If a step change is required specify the second value as 1 rpm more for example rpm1 = 6000 and 
rpm2 = 6001. For more information see <a href="VVT_VVL.htm">Modeling of VVT and VVL</a></p>

<h2>Cam Data</h2>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/ExCamImpHelp.jpg" width="327" height="543"></p>

<p>The cam, or more accurately, the valve lift data is imported as a file. This data can 
be generated by another application all together. This file must have the following format:</p> 

<ul>
  <li>An optional user specified number of header rows that describes
    the file content.&nbsp; (min=0)</li>
  <li>Following this, two columns that are space or tab delimited that
    lists the degree values in column one and the lift values in column two. </li>
  <li>The degree values can be either crankshaft or camshaft degrees.
    The program will make the adjustment internally.</li>
  <li">The degrees must increase in steps of one degree per lift value
    and must start at zero lift and end again at zero lift.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following picture shows a typical 4stHEAD static valve lift file, column 
one is the degrees, column two the lift, three the velocity and four the 
acceleration.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/ExValveLiftFile.jpg" width="640" height="533"></p>

<h3>Imported File Name</h3>

<p>The name of the imported
file with its extension. The maximum total length including the extension is 80
characters. For this version of the program this file must be in the same directory as
Project. As shown, the file type can be one of the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>4stHEAD Static file (*.svl)</li>
  <li>4stHEAD Dynamic file (*.dvl)</li>
  <li>A Space separated file (*.prn)</li>
  <li>Comma separated file (*.csv)</li>
  <li>A general lift file (*.*)</li>
</ol>

<p class="MsoBodyText" align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/ExProfileFileSelect.jpg" width="429" height="350"></p>

<h3>Line Number Where Lift Data Starts</h3>

<p>The imported file can have
lines at the start of the file containing headers and other descriptors and values. The
software requires the number of the line where the actual degree and lift data starts.</p>

<h3>Crankshaft or Camshaft Degrees</h3>

<p>As it is possible to have a
lift profile in either crankshaft or camshaft degrees the user has to specify which format
is used in the imported file.</p>

<h3>Cam Timing Indexing Option</h3>

<p>To index the imported data to have the correct valve timing is not always simple. 
Four methods are provided:</p> 

<ol>
  <li>The first method is to specify the valve opening point.
    Depending on how the cam was measured and on the tappet clearance specified, this could
    lead to errors in the valve timing as small measurement errors and small tappet
    clearance errors can have a large influence on indexing the cam.</li>
  <li>The second method is to specify the cam (or lobe) centre
    position BTDC. The cam centre is defined as the centre of the period from
    the start of the opening ramp to the end of the closing ramp, that is the
    centre of the total cam profile including ramps. On a symmetrical lobe this is halfway between
    the opening and closing points, but on a non-symmetrical profile this is not necessary the
    case. When importing a file that describes dynamic lift with valve 
     bounce the final closing value can change and so will the cam centre. In this
    case it is recommended that one of the other methods be used.</li>
  <li>The third method is to specify the dwell centre
    position BTDC. The dwell centre is defined as the centre of the dwell period or in the case
    of no dwell, the point of the highest lift. On a symmetrical lobe this is halfway between
    the opening and closing points, but on a non-symmetrical profile this is not necessary the
    case.</li>
  <li>The fourth method is
    to prescribe the valve lift at TDC. This will be the lift as measured on an
    engine with the valve clearance set to the specified value.</li>
</ol>

<p>The following picture 
demonstrates the difference between <b>lobe centre</b> and <b>lift or dwell 
centre</b> (for illustrative purposes a large offset is used):</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/Lift-Lobe-Centre.jpg" width="905" height="424"></p>

<p>Whatever the method the user might have to make adjustments to the indexing degrees 
and tappet clearance to obtain the correct timing and duration.</p>

<p>At the end of this the screen will display typically the following data:</p>

<p>At this point in time it is possible to edit the data if you are not satisfied with the results.
Clicking on &quot;OK&quot; will accept the results while clicking on &quot;Edit Cam&quot; 
will take you back to the previous dialog.</p>
