<h2><u><b>Side Resonant Silencer</b></u></h2>
<p><font size="3">The side resonant silencer has a inner tube that has a few
holes in roughly the center of the tube as shown in the following figure. If the
length of the perforation exceeds about one third of the silencer length the
silencer should rather be modeled as an absorption silencer will low density
packing. Note where the main exhaust stops and the silencer begins. The silencer
is modeled as a tube with a three-way branch with the side branch connected to a
plenum as shown in the second figure. The main exhaust and the outlet pipe are
connected to the silencer using steps.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;The length and diameter of the side branch and the
volume of the plenum is calculated by the software. The steps, which can be
step-up or step-down steps are also calculated by the software. The following
picture shows the typical input data.</font></p>
