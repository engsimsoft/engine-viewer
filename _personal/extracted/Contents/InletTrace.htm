<title>Inlet Trace Positions</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1><b><u>Description of Inlet Trace Positions</u></b></h1>

<p>The software allows the placement of a transducer in each intake pipe.&nbsp; All the so
called &quot;trace&quot; results in the result files are at these points.</p>

<p>At these points the software outputs the pressure, 
temperature, mach index and the left and right moving wave pressure values.</p>

<p>For the inlet port this dimension is the distance the 
transducer is placed from the intake valve face in millimeters. If the distance 
is greater than the inlet port it is automatically placed in the cylinder pipe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the other pipes this dimension is the distance from
the end of that particular pipe. If the dimension is greater than the length of
that pipe it is placed at the start of the pipe. In the next figure this is 
illustrated for a single cylinder inlet with a throttle and boost bottle.</p>

<p>In this example the trace distance is shown 
to be almost halfway down the cylinder pipe, pipe 1. In the throttle body pipe, 
pipe 3, and the boost bottle pipe, pipe 4, this places the trace almost at the 
start of each pipe. For the connector pipe, pipe 2, the specified trace position 
is longer than the pipe and the trace is placed at the start of this pipe. </p>
<p>The next figure shows the positions of the 
inlet traces on a multi-cylinder engine. Note that the trace number corresponds 
to the pipe number and that all the traces is the same distance from the end of 
the pipe, unless the specified distance is greater than the pipe length, then 
the trace is at the start of the pipe.</p>
