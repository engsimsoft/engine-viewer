<h1>Creating a new Exhaust port with a User Generated Cam Lift Profile</h1>

<p>This section of the help pages describes how to create a generic
cam profile using the internal cam profile generator. The user will be prompted to supply
the following information:</p>

<h2>Port and Valve Data</h1>

<p>This section of the input data is identical for all the valves and cams.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" align="center">

<h3>Number of valves</h3>

<p>The maximum number of exhaust valves allowed is 2 and the minimum is 1. </p>

<h3>Number of Port Passages</h3>

<p>Some heads with two valves do not have siamesed ports 
with one outlet but two separate ports. The maximum number of exhaust passages allowed is 2 and the minimum
is 1. </p>

<h3>Masking of valves</h3>

<p>By choosing the amount of valve masking (interference to the flow
by the proximity of the cylinder liner), together with the number of valves, the program
will choose the relevant coefficient of discharge maps. Currently the choices are: </p>

<ol>
  <li>fully free flow</li>
  <li>partially masked</li>
  <li>severely masked</li>
  <li>user generated Cd-map</li>
</ol>

<h3>Cd-Map Multiplier</h3>

<p>Sometimes the engine starts off unmodified with a specific map and because it 
is modified the flow improves but not so much as to use the next map, the user 
can adjust the map to the new better flow conditions by multiplying the map by a 
factor. The maximum a map can be improved is 10% (factor = 1.1) before the next 
map should be used. The user can also start by using a better map and adjust it 
downward by up to 10% (factor = 0.9) to simulate the unmodified engine and the 
progressively adjust the map upward as the flow is improved. See also the help 
topic on <a href="PortFlowModeling.htm">Cd-maps</a>.</p>

<h3>Outer Seat Diameter on Valve</h3>

<p>The outer diameter of the valve seat area on the valve in millimetres.</p>

<h3>Port Throat Diameter</h3>

<p>The diameter of the narrowest part of the port at the valve end of the port 
between the valve guide and the valve seat in millimetres. This dimension is 
usually slightly smaller than the <b>valve seat inner diameter </b>but will 
not be bigger than it.</p>

<h3>Port Diameter at Manifold</h3>

<p>The port diameter in the head at the exhaust manifold face.</p>

<p>Diameter of valve stem in millimetres. This is the diameter of the
portion of the valve stem in the port.</p>

<h3>Valve Seat Angle</h3>

<p>The valve seat angle is half the included angle of the valve seat contact area relative 
to the valve stem center line.</p>

<h3>Length of Port Passage</h3>

<p>This is the effective or mean length of the port from the valve
seat surface to the manifold or spigot face in millimetres.</p>

<h3>Tappet Clearance</h3>

<p>This is the tappet clearance or valve train lash in millimetres.
The typical value for a generated lift profile is zero.</p>

<h2>Select Cam Control (VVT and/or VVL)</h2>

<p>The software can model variable valve lift combined with variable valve timing. This is achieved by specifying two
valve lift profiles, each with its own lift, duration and timing and the rpm value up to which profile 1 is used and 
the rpm value from which profile 2 is used. The simulation will use linear interpolation for timing and lift between 
the two rpm values. If a step change is required specify the second value as 1 rpm more for example rpm1 = 6000 and 
rpm2 = 6001. For more information see <a href="VVT_VVL.htm">Modeling of VVT and VVL</a></p>

<h2>Created Cam Data</h2>

<p><span style=" color=red"><b>Note: This lift profile generated here is not sophisticated 
enough to manufacture a cam from. Its purpose is to generate an approximation to use in 
the simulation if a measured profile is not available</b></span></p>

<p>The generated lift profile is based
on the method described by <a HREF="References.htm"><b>Blair (p35-p45)</b></a>. The lift profile is divided into 5
phases and a 3<sup>rd</sup> order polynomial is fitted to the first two and the last two.
It is important to note that this is the valve lift profile, which is the same as the cam
lift profile for a direct acting camshaft but can be substantially different for a system
with rockers and/or roller followers.</p>

<p>The first phase is known as the
opening ramp. This is the phase from valve opening until the end of positive acceleration
and <b>should not be confused with the ramp that takes up the lash adjustment.</b> The
duration of this phase is usually 40 degrees. The height of the valve lift during this
phase is typically 0.2 times the main lift for high performance engines and up to 0.5
times for low revving diesel engines. This value determines the amplitude of maximum
positive acceleration on the opening side. </p>

<p>The third phase is the dwell period
at maximum lift and can vary from zero to typically 10 degrees. High performance engines
tend to have zero degrees dwell. <b>The centre of the dwell period or the point of maximum
lift is defined as the lobe centre</b>.</p>

<p>The second phase, the main opening
lift phase, is the period from the end of the up ramp until the start of the dwell phase
or in the case of zero dwell, until maximum lift is reached. The acceleration is negative.</p>

<p>The fourth phase, the main closing
lift phase, is the period from the end of the dwell phase or in the case of zero dwell,
from maximum lift until the start of the closing ramp. The acceleration is negative.</p>

<p>The fifth phase is the closing ramp
and has the same typical values as the closing ramp. It starts at the end of the main
closing lift and continues to the point of valve closing. This value determines the
amplitude of maximum positive acceleration on the closing side.</p>

<p>This method of cam profile generation
starts at valve opening and ends at valve closing, thus the effect of lash or tappet
clearance has already been taken into consideration and should be set to 0. The final
output screen should show the inputted opening and closing values at tappet clearance. To
achieve special effects the engine modeller might experiment with this to achieve special
lift profiles.</p>

<p>By specifying a non-central lobe
centre and/or different opening and closing ramp and main lift values a non-symmetrical
lift profile can be generated.</p>

<p>The generated cam profile is stored
in a file with the same name as this subsystem but with the .eco extension. It is a normal
ASCI file and can be view with a standard spreadsheet program.</p>

<h3>Valve Opening before BDC</h3>

<p>The actual point of valve opening in degrees before bottom dead
centre (BBDC). This is the point in a real engine where all the lash in the valve train
has been taken up.</p>

<h3>Valve Closing after TDC</h3>

<p>The actual point of valve closing in degrees after top dead centre
(ATDC). This is the point in a real engine where all the lash in the valve train has been
taken up.</p>

<h3>Lift of Valve</h3>

<p>The lift of the valve from the opening point to the centre of the
lobe in millimetres.</p>

<h3>Opening Ramp Ratio</h3>

<p>The fraction of the valve lift during the opening positive
acceleration phase. (typically 0.2 for a high performance high revving engine and up to
0.5 for a low revving diesel engine)</p>

<h3>Closing Ramp Ratio</h3>

<p>The fraction of the valve lift during the closing positive
acceleration phase. (typically 0.2 for a high performance high revving engine and up to
0.5 for a low revving diesel engine) On a symmetrical lift profile it has the same value
as the opening ramp.</p>

<h3>Opening Ramp Duration</h3>

<p>The duration of the valve lift during the opening positive
acceleration phase. The polynomial was derived for a period of 40 degrees and it is
advisable to use this value.</p>

<h3>Closing Ramp Duration</h3>

<p>The duration of the valve lift during the closing positive
acceleration phase. The polynomial was derived for a period of 40 degrees and it is
advisable to use this value.</p>

<h3>Dwell Duration</h3>

<p>The period in degrees that the valve spends at maximum lift. Values
range from zero to 10 degrees.</p>

<h3>Cam Lobe Centre Position</h3>

<p>The cam lobe centre is defined as the centre point of the dwell
period or as the point at maximum lift for a cam with zero dwell. It can be defined in the
following two ways: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Central uses the centrepoint of the lift curve on a symmetrical profile</li>
  <li>Degrees after valve opening used for a non-symmetrical profile.</li>
</ul>
