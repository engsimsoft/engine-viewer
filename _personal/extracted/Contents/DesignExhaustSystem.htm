<h1><span lang=EN-AU>Designing a New Exhaust System</span></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-AU>When the manifold selection dialog box is displayed 
there is also a button <b>"Empirical Design of Exhaust Pipe"</b> at the bottom of the dialog. This 
gives the choice to the user to use empiricism to design an exhaust system to use as starting 
point:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img width=660 height=654
src="../Pictures/ExDesignButton.jpg"></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-AU>After clicking this button the design dialog opens. There 
are three (two for single cylinders) manifold choices displayed:
<ul>
	<li>Open ended pipe - a plain pipe open to the atmosphere with or without steps
	<li>Megaphone pipe  - a straight pipe connected to a megaphone and from there to the atmosphere
	<li>Collector type  - straight header pipes connected to a collector pipe and from there to atmosphere.
</ul></span></p>

<h2><span lang=EN-AU>Tuned Length</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Before designing a pipe it is necessary to explain the concept 
of <b>Tuned length</b>. The tuned length of an exhaust pipe is that length of pipe that causes a negative 
exhaust pressure at the cylinder during the valve overlap period at maximum power. The following image 
shows this tuned length for the three types of pipes:
<ul>
	<li>Open Ended Pipe - Tuned length is from the exhaust valve to the atmospheric end of the pipe
	<li>Megaphone Pipe  - The tuned length is from the exhaust valve to 1/3rd down the megaphone
	<li>Collector Type  - The tuned length is from the exhaust valve to the collector junction.
</ul>
It is important to note that this is just an approximation and the final lengths must be fine tuned through simulation.</span></p>

<h2><span lang=EN-AU>Example 1: Open ended pipe</span></h2>

<p>The <b>&quot;Separate Straight Pipes&quot;</b> radio button is selected and the 
estimated bulk temperature is entered. Note how the tuned length updates as the 
value is filled in. Next, two steps are selected by entering the value &quot;2&quot;. 
Finally we want a step at the export/pipe junction with an area ratio of 1.1 so 
we enter the value:</p>

<img border="0" src="../Pictures/ExDesignStraightInput.jpg" width="581" height="602"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:left'>
To see what the pipe will look like we click the <b>&quot;Display&quot;</b> button:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/ExDesignStraightDisplay.jpg" width="1004" height="330"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:left'>
As can be seen the pipe has two steps. Also note the export length has been 
subtracted from the first part. The overall pipe length is now displayed in the 
dialog box:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/ExDesignStraightOutput.jpg" width="581" height="602"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:left'>
If we are satisfied with this pipe we click the &quot;Accept&quot; button and this pipe is 
saved for all the cylinders. Alternatively we could modify some parameters and 
display the pipe again, until we are satisfied.</p>

<h2><span lang=EN-AU>Example 2: Megaphone pipe</span></h2>

<p>The <b>&quot;Separate with Megaphone&quot;</b> radio button is selected and the 
estimated bulk temperature is entered. Note how the tuned length updates as the 
value is filled in. Next, the megaphone length coefficient is selected by 
entering the value &quot;0.75&quot;, followed by the megaphone diameter coefficient by 
entering &quot;3&quot;. Finally we want a step at the export/pipe junction with an area 
ratio of 1.1 so we enter the value:</p>

<img border="0" src="../Pictures/ExDesignMegaDisplay.jpg" width="1004" height="330"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:left'>
As can be seen this is a straight pipe with a megaphone. On the dialog the 
megaphone header length and megaphone length is displayed:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/ExDesignMegaOutput.jpg" width="581" height="602"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:left'>
If we are satisfied with this pipe we click the &quot;Accept&quot; button and this pipe is 
saved for all the cylinders. Alternatively we could modify some parameters and 
display the pipe again, until we are satisfied.</p>

<h2><span lang=EN-AU>Example 3: Collector Type</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:left'>
The <b>&quot;N into 1&quot;</b> radio button is selected (N is the number of cylinders) 
and the estimated bulk temperature is entered. Note how the tuned length updates 
as the value is filled in. Next, the collector diameter coefficient is selected 
by entering the value &quot;2.6&quot;. Finally we want a step at the export/pipe junction 
with an area ratio of 1.1 so we enter the value:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/ExDesignCollInput.jpg" width="581" height="602"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:left'>
To see what the pipe will look like we click the <b>&quot;Display&quot;</b> button (Please 
note that the the two short stubs at the collector boundary is shown only to 
indicate where the other pipes join, and can number from 2 to 16):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/ExDesignCollDisplay.jpg" width="1004" height="330"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:left'>
On the dialog the&nbsp; header length and collector pipe length is displayed:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/ExDesignColloutput.jpg" width="581" height="602"></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">If we are satisfied with this pipe we click 
the &quot;Accept&quot; button and this pipe is saved for all the cylinders. Alternatively 
we could modify some parameters and display the pipe again, until we are 
satisfied. When this pipe is saved the dialog opens where the collector junction 
inter pipe angles have to be entered.</p>
