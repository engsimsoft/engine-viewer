<h2>Turbocharger Modeling</h2>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>NOTE: This is the fifth release of the turbocharger 
module and a number of options discussed here are not yet available but under 
development.</b></font></p>

<p>A turbocharger is modeled by importing a compressor map and a turbine 
swallowing curve. Once this is done the rest of the turbocharger characteristics 
are added. To select a turbocharged engine the following radio button is 
selected on the main engine dialog:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/TurboEngineMenuTurbo.jpg"></p>

<p align="left">After saving the engine subsystem the turbocharger dialog will 
open:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/TurboNewMenu.jpg"></p>

<h3 align="left">Number of Turbochargers</h3>

<p align="left">The user can select between one and two turbochargers.</p>

<h3 align="left">Multi Turbo Configuration</h3>

<p align="left">If two turbochargers were selected the user has the choice 
between two parallel turbos (typically one per bank on a Vee or Flat engine) or 
two sequential turbos where one is the low pressure stage (LP) and one is the 
high pressure stage (HP), typically this is used on a highly boosted 3 or 4 
cylinder engine. For the first case the two parallel turbos use the same 
compressor map and turbine swallowing curve, while for the sequential case each 
turbo has its own compressor map and turbine swallowing curve.</p>

<h3 align="left">Wastegate</h3>

<p align="left">The user select whether a wastegate is fitted or not. There are two 
options if a wastegate is fitted: </p>

<ul>
	<li>If a single boost value is selected the user has to supply the following data:
	<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="../Pictures/TurboWasteGateData.jpg"></p></li>
	<li>If a boost map is selected the user has to supply the following data:
	<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="../Pictures/TurboWasteGateData1.jpg"></p></li>
	<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="../Pictures/TurboWasteGateCurveData.jpg"></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Using the button "<b>Draw BoostCurve</b>" the boost curve is displayed:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/BoostCurveGraph.jpg"></p>

<h3 align="left">Boost Measurement Point</h3>

<p align="left">The user has to select where the boost pressure and boost temperature 
will be measured. This is the point where the pressure will be measured for wastegate 
or other boost control as well as the value that goes into the results files.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/TurboBoostPressPoint.jpg"></p>

<h3 align="left">Boost Control on Compressor Side</h3>

<p align="left">The boost pressure can also be controlled on the compressor side 
by using a &quot;blow off valve&quot; or &quot;bypass control&quot;. Blow off is inefficient as 
pressure is just bleat to atmosphere. Bypass control is also used to control 
boost but is used to prevent compressor surge during sudden shutting of the 
throttle.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/TurboBoostControl.jpg"></p>

<h3 align="left">Moment of Inertia (MoI)</h3>

<p align="left">The turbo does not operate at a constant speed but accelerates 
and decelerates continuously during operation. To capture these dynamics 
correctly the moment of inertia must be supplied. The user can choose to supply 
the MoI of each of the 3 main&nbsp; components separately or combined. This is a 
very difficult value to obtain so a calculator has been added that calculates a 
first order approximation from the compressor and turbine dimensions that has 
been entered.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/TurboMoIMenu.jpg"></p>

<h3 align="left">Turbine Entry Type</h3>
<p>There are three options available for the turbine entry:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/TurboTurbineEntry.jpg"></p>

<h3 align="left">Turbine Inlet Guide Vanes</h3>

<p>There are three options available for guide vanes in the impellor inlet, no guide vanes,
fixed guide vanes and moveable guide vanes, also known as variable geometry turbine (VGT). 
If the VGT option is selected the turbine characteristic must be a family of swallowing curves 
with each curve the value for a different vane angle.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/TurboTurbineGeometry.jpg"></p>

<h3>Back Pressure Measurement Position</h3>

<p>There are three back pressure measurement positions available to choose from:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Turbine Entry</b> This is the default position and the generally accepted option.</li>
	<li><b>Exhaust Port</b> This option will show the highest value and is the actual value 
	that influences the engine performance but not easy to measure in practice.</li>
	<li><b>Collector</b> This option is often chosen in practice because of accessibility 
	reasons. It will give a back pressure value slightly higher than the turbine entrace value.</li> 
</ul>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/BackPressureMeasurementPoint-02.jpg"></p>

<h3>Compressor Map and Characteristics</h3>

<p>The compressor map and characteristics are generated by the <b>DigiComp</b> software which 
generates a file with the impeller dimensions and flow characteristics in a format required 
by the simulation software. To import a compressor map the button "<b>Select Compressor 
File</b>" is clicked which opens a typical file open dialog where the relevant file is selected:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/TurboSelectComp.jpg"</p>

<p>After selecting the file the dialog is updated by displaying the file name and the relevent 
impeller dimensional data:

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/TurboCompSelected.jpg"></p>

<h3>Turbine Map and Characteristics</h3>

<p>The turbine map and characteristics are generated by the <b>DigiTurb</b> software which 
generates a file with the turbine dimensions and flow characteristics in a format required 
by the simulation software. To import a turbine map the button "<b>Select Turbine 
File</b>" is clicked which opens a typical file open dialog where the relevant file is selected:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/TurboSelectTurb.jpg"></p>

<p>After selecting the file the dialog is updated by displaying the file name and the relevent 
turbine dimensional data:

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/TurboTurbSelected.jpg"></p>

<p>After selecting both the compressor and turbine we can now test the first order matching 
of the compressor and turbine to the engine. This matching is done at the maximum power rpm 
value as specified on the engine dialog. To test the compressor matching click on the <b>"Plot"</b>
button next to the compressor file name:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/TurboCompMatch.jpg"></p>

<p>The red dot on the compressor map is the area where the compressor will operate under the current 
assumptions of volumetric efficiency and heat release rates. This is internal to the software and 
cannot be changed by the user. In this case we see it is very close to the surge line indicating that
this compressor is probably too big for this engine.</p>

<p>Next we test the matching of the turbine by clicking on the <b>"Plot"</b>
button next to the turbine file name:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/TurboTurbMatch.jpg"></p>

<p>The red dot on the swallowing curve is the probable area where the turbine will operate. 
The green dot is the full engine mass flow and the difference will flow through the wastegate.</p>

<p>The final bit of data required is the moment of inertia of the rotor. As this is very seldom 
available a utility is included in the software that estimates it from the compressor wheel 
diameter. Clicking on the <b>"Estimate MoI"</b> button the following is displayed:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/TurboMoIEstimated.jpg"></p>

<p>The <b>"Save and Exit"</b> button can now be clicked.</p>
