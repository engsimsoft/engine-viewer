<title>Exhaust Pipe Numbering Convention</title>
</head>

<body>

<h2>Exhaust Pipe
Numbering Convention<o:p></o:p></h2>

<p>
Before the numbering convention is discussed it is necessary to first define what is meant by a pipe:</p>

<p><b></b>A Pipe is a piece of tube that runs from one boundary to the next with no discontinuities in between.</p>

<p><b><a href="ExPipeBoundaries.htm">Boundaries</a>:</b></p>

<ul>
 <li>Start of a pipe at the cylinder manifold face</li>
 <li>End of a pipe open to the atmosphere</li>
 <li>A collector (multi-pipe joint)</li>
 <li>The entry to or exit from a box or plenum</li>
 <li>The entry to a silencer</li> 
 <li>A step up or down</li>
 <li>The entry to or exit from a turbine</li>
 <li>The entry to or exit from a wastegate</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: A straight pipe connected to a gradual area change
(diffuser) is not a boundary but just one pipe with 2 sections.</p>

<h2><u>Pipe Numbering</u></h2>

<p>Pipes are numbered in the direction of major flow starting
at the cylinders and in cylinder sequence. Using this sequence the pipes
connecting to the cylinder pipes are numbered next and this process is
continued until the last pipe open to the atmosphere is numbered. This is
demonstrated in the following example:</p>

<h2>Example 1 : Demonstration of Pipe numbering process</h2>

<p>This example shows the layout and pipe numbering for a
four-cylinder engine fitted with a 4into2into1 pipe system fitted with a box.
Each header pipe has one step in it, the collector pipe also has a step and the
box has 3 outlet pipes. The numbering is shown in the following figure (also
take note of what each pipe is called):</p>

<h2>Example 2 : Demonstration of Pipe numbering process if there are steps in a 
pipe system with 2 collectors</h2>

<p>This example shows the layout and pipe numbering for a
eight-cylinder engine fitted with two 4into1 pipe systems.
Each collector pipe also has two steps in it. The numbering is shown in the 
following figure:</p>

<h2>Pipe Section Numbering</h2>

<p>Pipes with gradual area changes are subdivided into
sections. These sections are also numbered in the major direction of flow. A
pipe can have no less than 1 section and a maximum of 12 sections. To identify
which pipe a section belongs to a section is numbered using a double index
system, the first index identifies the pipe it belongs to and the second index
is the section number. For example, <b>section(2,3)</b> means section 3 in pipe
2. Each section has to be supplied with a length dimension. This is
demonstrated in the following two examples:</p>

<h2>Example 3 : Pipe section numbering on a single cylinder engine</h2>

<p>A single cylinder engine fitted with a megaphone exhaust
system is shown. The megaphone is fitted with a small reverse cone. This engine
has thus only one pipe but with the pipe divided into three sections, a
parallel pipe, a diffuser and a reverse cone.</p>

<h2>Example 4 : Pipe section numbering on a multi-cylinder engine</h2>

<p>This example shows the same basic pipe configuration as
used in Example 1 but with the steps replaced with short tapered sections.</p>

<p align=center><img src="../Pictures/Num421NoSteps.jpg"></p>

<h2>Section Diameter Numbering Convention</h2>

<p>A section has only one length but it has two diameters;
the starting diameter and the finishing diameter. For a parallel pipe the two
diameters are the same but for a taper pipe they are not. The first diameter of
a pipe is numbered as 0. After that each diameter has the number of the section
leading up to it. This means that the starting diameter of a section, other
than the first section, will have the number of the previous section. This is
shown in the next example.</p>

<h2><b>Example 5 : Pipe section diameter numbering</b></h2>

<p>The same pipe as in Example 3 is used but with the diameter numbers added.</p>
