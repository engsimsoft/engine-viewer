<title>Exhaust Trace Positions</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1><b><u>Description of Exhaust Trace Positions</u></b></h1>

<p>The software allows the placement of a transducer in each 
exhaust port or header pipe as well as in the rest of the exhaust pipes.
All the so called &quot;trace&quot; results in the result files are at these
points.</p>

<p>At these points the software outputs the pressure, 
temperature, mach index and the left and right moving wave pressure values.</p>

<p>For the header/tuned pipes this dimension is the distance 
the transducer is placed from the exhaust valve face in millimeters. If the 
distance is greater than the exhaust port it is automatically placed in the 
header pipe else it is in the port. If the distance places it further away 
from the port face than the sum of the port and header length it is positioned 
at the end of the header&nbsp; pipe.</p>

<p>For the other pipes this dimension is the distance from 
the start of that particular pipe. If the dimension is greater than the length 
of that pipe it is placed at the end of the pipe. In the next figure this is 
illustrated for a single cylinder pipe.</p>

<p>In this example the trace distance is shown 
to be almost halfway down the pipe 1. If the distance was shorter than the 
exhaust port length the trace position would have been in the exhaust port. For 
the pipe 2, the specified trace position is shorter than the 
pipe and the trace is placed at the trace length from the start of this pipe. </p>

<p>Note that the trace number corresponds to 
the pipe number and that all the traces is the same distance from the start of 
the pipe, unless the specified distance is greater than the pipe length, then 
the trace is at the end of the pipe. The next figure shows the trace positions 
for a multi-cylinder exhaust system.</p>
