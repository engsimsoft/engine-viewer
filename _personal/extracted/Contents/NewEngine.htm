<h1><b><u>Description of Engine Parameters

</span></u></b></h1>
<p>When creating a new engine the following dialog will appear:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/NewEngine.jpg"></p>

<h3><strong><u>Engine Induction</u></strong></h3>

<p>The user can choose between "<b>Naturally Aspirated</b>", 
"<b>Turbocharged</b>" or "<b>Supercharged</b>". </p>

<h3><u>Combustion Type</u></h3>

<p>The next choice is the type of ignition system. There are two types
to choose from; <b>spark ignition</b> (typically gasoline or alcohol) and <b>compression ignition</b>
(typically diesel). The choice will influence the loss factors for mechanical efficiency
and the fuel types available in the combustion subsystem.</p>

<h3><b><u>Engine Layout</u></b></h3>

<p>If the number of cylinders are larger than 1 the type of engine
layout has to be specified. There are three possible choices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Inline engine</li>
  <li>V-layout</li>
  <li>Flat layout (also known as opposed cylinders or boxer)</li>
</ul>

<h3><b><u>Friction Model

</u></b></h3>
<p>The user can choose between "<b>Plain</b>" or&nbsp; "<b>Roller</b>" 
bearings or a "<b>User Defined</b>" friction loss model. The type of bearing 
is used in the friction loss calculations. Most other engines 
use the plain bearing type. The "<b>User Defined</b>" model requires the user 
to supply two or three values, a static component that stays the same through the rpm 
sweep, a dynamic component that is the slope of the loss characteristic that 
is rpm dependent and a speed loss component that is a function of the rpm 
squared. The user can by manipulating these values take the loss of a 
rear wheel dyno into consideration.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/FrictionModel.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Loss Coefficient:</b> This is a value that is independent of engine speed, 
seal friction, plain bearings etc. contribute to this value. Seals have a value 
of around 1000 while plain bearings a value of around 100 000.</p>
<p><b>Loss Slope:</b> This is the slope of the speed dependant value of the 
friction loss. A typical ball or roller bearing engine has a loss slope of about 
+100. Currently the user is allowed to specify only a linear dependence on 
speed. A more sophisticated model will follow that allows a non-linear 
dependence.</p>
<p><b>Speed Loss:</b> This is the coefficient of the rpm squared in a friction 
model where the loss is not a straight line.</p>
<p>The user can model the crankshaft bearings, valve train and reciprocating 
components in a separate program called <b>"FMEP"</b> to determine these three 
values.</p>
<p>On a rear wheel dyno all sorts of additional losses comes into play, some 
might decrease with speed, others stay constant and some increase with speed. 
The user will have to experiment to find the model that simulates his setup the 
best.</p>

<h2><u>Basic Engine Data</u></h2>

<h3><b><u>Number of Cylinders</u></b></h3>

<p>Choose the number of cylinders. If for instance a V-engine is
modeled where no interconnection exists between the intake and the exhaust system of the
left and right hand banks of cylinders it is more efficient to model only one bank. This
reduces run times. If the exhaust and intake systems are completely separate for each
cylinder it is only necessary to model one cylinder.</p>

<h3><b><u>Bore</u></b></h3>

<p>Enter the cylinder bore in millimeters. Only round bores are
modeled.</p>

<h3><b><u>Stroke</u></b></h3>

<p>Enter the stroke length in millimeters. Strictly speaking 
this is twice the crank throw as the stroke will increase slightly if an offset 
is defined for the gudgeon pin.</p>

<h3><b><u>Conrod Length</u></b></h3>

<p>Enter the conrod length in millimeters. It is the length
from the center of the big-end eye to the center of the small-end eye. The length of the
conrod influences the movement of the piston and should be as accurate as
possible.</p>

<h3><b><u>Gudgeon Pin and/or Cylinder Offset</u></b></h3>

<p>Enter the offset in millimeters. A positive number is 
used if the offset is in the direction of rotation and a negative number if the 
offset is in the opposite direction of crank rotation. The offset influences the movement
of the piston and should be as accurate as possible. A positive value means the offset is
in the direction of crankshaft rotation.</p>

<h3><b><u>Geometric Compression Ratio

</u></b></h3>

<p>This is the compression ratio calculated using the
full stroke  and is used to determine the
trapped head volume at TDC.</p>
<h3><b><u>Squish Area Ratio

</u></b>
</h3>
<p>This is the area ratio calculated using the area of the 
squish band divided by the bore cross sectional area. It is constrained to 
values from 0.0 to 0.7.</p>
<h3><u>Piston Dome Radius</u><b><u>

</u></b></h3>
<p>The radius of the piston dome in millimeters. Currently 
the squish radius is calculated internally by the software to the sum of the 
piston dome radius and the squish clearance, giving a parallel squish clearance.</p>

<h3><b><u>RPM at maximum power</u></b></h3>

<p>This value is used in the pipe wall temperature subroutine where
the pipe wall temperature is scaled according to the simulated rpm in relation to the
maximum power rpm. It is also used to calculate the Specific Time Areas.</p>

<h3><b><u>Exhaust Transducers</u></b></h3>

<p>The software allows the placement of a transducer in each 
exhaust port or header pipe as well as in the rest of the exhaust pipes.
All the so called "trace" results in the result files are at these
points.</p>
<p>At these points the software outputs the pressure, 
temperature, mach index and the left and right moving wave pressure values.</p>
<p>For the header pipes this dimension is the distance the 
transducer is placed from the exhaust valve face in millimeters. If the distance 
is greater than the exhaust port length it is automatically placed in the header pipe 
else it is in the port. If the distance places it further away from the port 
face than the sum of the port and header lengths it is positioned at
the end of the header pipe.</p>
<p>For the other pipes this dimension is the distance from
the start of that particular pipe. If the dimension is greater than the length
of that pipe it is placed at the end of the pipe. 
See <a href="ExhaustTrace.htm">Exhaust Trace Definition</a> for more information.</p>

<h3><b><u>Intake Transducers</u></b></h3>

<p>The software allows the placement of a transducer in each 
intake pipe.&nbsp; All the so
called "trace" results in the result files are at these points.</p>
<p>At these points the software outputs the pressure, 
temperature, mach index and the left and right moving wave pressure values.</p>
<p>For the cylinder pipe this dimension is the distance the 
transducer is placed from the intake valve face in millimeters. If the distance 
is greater than the cylinder pipe it is automatically placed in the cylinder pipe.</p>
<p>For the other pipes this dimension is the distance from
the end of that particular pipe. If the dimension is greater than the length of
that pipe it is placed at the start of the pipe. See <a href="InletTrace.htm">Inlet 
Trace Definition</a> for more information.</p>

<h3><b><u>Number of Iteration Cycles</u></b></h3>

<p>This determines the number of complete engine cycles
(where one cycle is two revolutions) that the engine will be simulated for. The
minimum allowed is 8 as this is typically the least number of cycles for the
calculation of a naturally aspirated to stabilize.</p>

<h4>1. Naturally Aspirated</h4>

<p>Some engines require more but very seldom more than
12 cycles. In general the points after max power require more cycles to stabilize so a 
suggestion is to run a simulation for the highest rpm point required for 
20 cycles without graphics and to inspect the results to determine after how many 
cycles the simulation has stabilized to your satisfaction. Set the number of 
cycles to this value.</p>

<h4>2. Mechanical Supercharged</h4>

<p>Start with 30 cycles, some engines require more but very seldom more than
80 cycles. A turbocharged engine typically requires 5 times as many cycles for 
the gasdynamics to stabilize compared to a naturally aspirated engine. In general 
the points after max power require more cycles to stabilize so a 
suggestion is to run a simulation for the highest rpm point required for 
100 cycles without graphics and to inspect the results to determine after how many 
cycles the simulation has stabilized to your satisfaction. Set the number of 
cycles to this value.</p>

<h4>3. Turbocharged</h4>

<p>Start with 80 cycles, some engines require more but very seldom more than
120 cycles. A turbocharged engine typically requires <b>10 times</b> as many cycles 
for the gasdynamics to stabilize compared to a naturally aspirated engine. To assist 
the simulation the turbocharger speed is fixed for the first 8 cycles and then 
the compressor and turbine maps is progressively built up until cycle 18. The 
first realistic but not converged results are from cycle 40 onwards.</p>

<p>In general the points after max power require more cycles to stabilize so a 
suggestion is to run a simulation for the highest rpm point required for 
200 cycles without graphics and to inspect the results to determine after how many 
cycles the simulation has stabilized to your satisfaction. Set the number of 
cycles to this value.</p>

<h3><u><b>Throttle Open Ratio</b></u></h3>

<p>This is a number greater than 0 and less or equal to 1. If the slide or 
butterfly has moved through 50% of its lift or angle the ratio is 0.5 etc. 
Note that this function is only active if an inlet system with a throttle 
is selected.</p>

<h3><b><u>Engine Firing Order and Layout of the Crankshaft</u></b></h3>

<p>A range of firing orders and crank layouts are available. This
include single plane, two plane and multi-plane crank layouts with most of the more common
firing orders available.</p>

<h3><u>Combustion Chamber Layout</u></h3>

<p>The user selects the layout that mostly resembles the engine being modeled. 
This will be used in the turbulent combustion model to calculate the influence 
of swirl, tumble or a combination of the two, sometimes called "swumble".</p>

<p>The user also has to specify the included angle between the inlet and exhaust 
valve. This value is not currently used but planned for a future update of the 
"tumble" generation model.</p>
