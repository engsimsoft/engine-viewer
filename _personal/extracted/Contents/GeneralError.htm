<h1><span style="font-weight: 400">General Dialog Box Error</span></h1>
<p>The software is written using modal dialog boxes. This means that you can open more 
than one dialog box but cannot proceed without closing all of them. Some typical examples are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sometimes a warning message is not canceled by the user but obscured by clicking in another 
	dialog box, an action that brings the other dialog box to the front and sends the warning 
	message to the back.</li>
	<li>The same can happen to a file save or file open dialog box. The user wants to save the file but 
	with a new name and opens the file save dialog box. If the main dialog box is now inadvertently 
	clicked, the file save dialog is send to the back. The user now clicks again on the save button 
	and a new file save dialog box opens.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both the above examples will let the user continue until he wants to close the main dialog 
box when the software will not allow the completion. The solution is to drag the main dialog 
box out of the way to see if there are unclosed dialog boxes or message boxes behind it.</p>

<p>The following dialog box is always there and not an error:</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>In this example we open the file selection dialog in the cam data dialog by clicking on the
"Select Cam Lift File 1 to Import" button:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/CamSelectionError-01.jpg"></p>

<p>Before selecting a file we click on the main dialog and the file dialog disappears:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/CamSelectionError-02.jpg"></p>

<p>If we now click on the "Select Cam Lift File 1 to Import" button again the following message 
is displayed:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/CamSelectionError-03.jpg"></p>

<p>After cancelling this message neither the "Accept and Save" button or the "Exit without saving" 
button works. If we now drags the main dialog to one side the following is visible underneath it:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../Pictures/CamSelectionError-04.jpg"></p>

<p>There are two dialogs visible behind the main dialog, the startup dialog that is always there 
and the file selection dialog that we opened but never closed. Clicking on its edge will bring it 
to the front and we can now either complete the file selection operation or cancel it. Once that is 
done we can now close the main dialog.</p>

<p>Another way to find the errand dialog is to click on its icon in the task bar. There will be 
second icon behind the main icon in the task bar if a second dialog is open. Clicking on the edge 
of the rear icon will bring the hidden dialog to the front where it can be completed.</p>

<h2>When an unsolved error occurs:</h2>

<p>Make screen shots and exit Dat4T. Then send the screen shots and the file "C:\4Stroke\Dat4TErrorLog.dat" 
to Vannik Developments at: <a href="mailto:vannik@mweb.co.za">vannik@mweb.co.za</a></p>
