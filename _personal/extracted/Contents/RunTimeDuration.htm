<title>Run Time Duration</title>
</head>

<h1>Run Time Duration</h1>
<p>One of the major factors controlling the time a simulation takes (on any 
simulator) is the number of meshes or control volumes the ducts are divided 
into. Now we also have to take into consideration that for accuracy sake we want 
the wave to travel about one mesh length or slightly less per revolution. If it 
is more we have a numerically unstable situation and the software crashes (we 
are trying to extrapolate). If it travels a lot less than the mesh length we 
loose resolution and start getting smearing. So what the software does at each 
rpm point is it uses an assumed pipe temperature, calculate the wave speed and 
then calculate a mesh length that will give an increment about every one degree. 
We now have to verify that this increment length will result in a minimum of 
three meshes in the shortest pipe - for the numerical method to work you need a 
minimum of three meshes. So now the software checks all the pipes/ducts and if one is 
found with less than 3 meshes the mesh length is decreased until three meshes fits. At 
the end of this we have the final mesh length and if this is much shorter than 
what we started with we will end up with lots more meshes and the degree 
increment will be smaller as well. So we end up getting penalised twice for very 
short pipes, more meshes to calculate for and more increments per revolution.</p>

<p>To minimize the run time the solution is to increase the length of the shortest 
duct/pipe to minimize this effect. The aim is to have no duct shorter than the minimum 
length for the lowest rpm point to be simulated as listed in the following table but 
this requires us find a trade off between run time and accuracy. The best solution 
is to lengthen the shortest duct/pipe to this minimum length for an exhaust pipe/duct and 
for an inlet pipe/duct and to subtract this correction from a mating duct/pipe to 
maintain the correct overall length.</p>

<p>The following table gives an indication what the minimum inlet and exhaust lengths 
should be for the minimum simulation rpm to not effect the run time negatively. Shorter 
lengths can be used but it will increase the run time.

<p>Please note the following:
<ul>
	<li>In an effort to ensure accuracy below 4500 rpm the minimum 
	length stays as specified for 4500 rpm. This will lead to longer 
	run times below 4500rpm.</li>
	<li>If a silencer is used the way it is modeled internally will 
	result in very short ducts which will dramatically increase the 
	run times.</li>
	<li>A turbocharger simulation requires over a 100 iterations for 
	the turbocharger model to stabilize.</li>
	<li>The pipe joint subroutine (collector) is not an efficient 
	piece of software and more collectors lead to slower run times.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following example illustrates what we are trying to achieve:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/ShortestPipeLength.bmp"></p>

<p>In this example, for a total length of 120mm the unmodified version would be divided 
into 12 meshes while the modified one will be 8 meshes, leading to approximately a 30% 
reduction reduction in run time.</p>

<p>To facilitate this the pipe, duct or passage length tool has been added in Dat2T. It 
is accessed by clicking on the "<b>Pipe, Duct & Passage Check</b>" button on the main 
editing screen:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/PipeCheck01.jpg"></p>

<p>This brings up the following dialog with the duct and length value that is an issue 
plus the recommended length:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../Pictures/PipeCheck02.jpg"></p>

<p>After changing the pipe length rerun the check until no more pipes are shown with 
a recommended length. This means that the pipe length is no longer influencing run 
times.</p>
