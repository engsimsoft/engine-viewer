<h2><u>The Theory behind a Cd-map</u></h2>

<p>When flow passes through a restriction (valve curtain area, venturi, butterfly etc) the flow is 
never as good as it would have been if there was no restriction or if the pipe or duct was unobstructed 
but with the same area as the restriction. This difference between the actual flow and the undisturbed 
unobstructed flow is defined by the coefficient of discharge (discharge coefficient, Cd value). 

This Cd value has two problems when using it in simulation software:

<ul>
  <li>The definition of the Cd value.</li>
  <li>The fact that it is also a function of pressure across the obstruction (pressure ratio).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>The definition of the Cd value</h3>

<p>The "traditional" definition of the Cd-value is in words: <b>"The actual mass flow divided by the ideal isentropic 
mass flow as calculated using the isentropic nozzle equation."</b> In the rest of the discussion this Cd-value will be 
called the <b>Cdi-value</b>.</p>

<p>The problem with using the Cdi-value in simulation software is that simulation software is at the very least 
non-isentropic and as a preference non-homentropic. To put it simply, isentropic software cannot adequately take 
temperature into consideration, leading to large mass flow errors. We need the most accurate solution we can obtain. 
The following two pictures shows firstly an example of flow versus lift obtained on a flowbench with the test pressure 
at 28"H20 (28 inches of water) and then the Cdi-value for this flow:</p>

<p align="left">The fact that the Cdi-value is greater than 1.0 means that the flow area specified for the calculation 
was slightly larger than the actual value. This can be because of measurement error when the valve and seat was measured 
or a slight variation in the seat angle or incorrect specification of the ambient conditions.</p>

<p>What any simulation software requires is a Cd-value which will result in the correct mass flow calculation. To define 
the "actual" Cd in words: <b>It is the ratio of the actual measured mass flow divided by the mass flow the software would 
predict if the flow was unobstructed.</b> Dat4T calculates this value, the Cda-value from the measured flow bench data. The 
next picture shows this result:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="Cda-Cdi.jpg" width="726" height="525"></p>

<p align="left">The interesting thing here is that up to medium lift levels the two Cd-values are not much different but 
at higher lifts they differ quite substantially. If the Cdi value was used in a simulation it would under predict the 
mass flow at high lifts.</p>

<h3>The definition of the Cd-map</h3>

<p>So far we have obtained a Cda-curve which gives the Cda-value as tested at the testing pressure of the flowbench which 
has a pressure ratio across the obstruction. The Cda-value is also a function of the pressure ratio (it requires testing 
at other pressures as well). The next picture taken from <a HREF="References.htm">reference 3</a> shows such a map where 
pressure ratio was also taken into account:</p>

<p align="center">

<p align="left">Too illustrate the problem we have in constructing a complete Cd-map the pressure ratio of a flowbench 
operating at 28"H2O is added to the map as a red line. The pressure ratio of 28"H2O is 1.07:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="5ValveInflowCd-map28inch.jpg" width="708" height="643"></p>

<p align="left">Clearly this is a problem for most tuners as it is very rare to find the required test equipment outside 
a research laboratory. To test up to a pressure ratio of 2 would require testing at about 406"H2O. This is for the majority 
not possible.</p>

<p>In Dat4T this problem is solved by selecting the appropriate map for the port configuration (this is done automatically 
when the number of valves per port and the head layout is selected). There is a further requirement as there are three maps 
available for each port/head configuration based on the amount of valve masking (shrouding):

<ul>
  <li>Free flow - almost no masking.</li>
  <li>Partially masked - moderate masking.</li>
  <li>Severely masked - very bad masking by cylinder walls and combustion chamber walls.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The tuner will have to make a judgement call to select the best map based on his knowledge of the engine. There are 
some guidance given in the topic <a HREF="../contents/PortFlowModeling.htm">Port Flow Modeling</a> in the help files.</p>

<h3>User Defined Cd-map</h3>

<p>In Dat4T the solution is to use the measured flow data, convert it to Cda data and use the Cda data to determine a 
correction to the selected map. At the pressure ratio point where the flowbench test was done this will be exactly correct. 
For the rest of the map it will be an approximation but tests so far has shown it to be a good compromize.</p>
