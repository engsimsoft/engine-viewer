## [2 to 4 Cylinder Graphics]{.underline}

[When choosing to display the graphics of a 2 to 4 cylinder engine on the screen further options exist: ]{lang="EN-UK" style="font-size:12.0pt"}

1.  The first option is to display the intake pressure ratio traces for all the cylinders on one graph.
2.  The second option is to display the exhaust pressure ratio traces for all the cylinders on one graph.
3.  The third option displays the intake and exhaust traces similar to the single cylinder option. Two further options are available when choosing this option:

- Show individual graphs for all the cylinders
- Choose one cylinder to display.

The final

option chooses between displaying the intake or exhaust side traces.

The following figure shows the choices:

Selecting the intake side the pressure traces for the final cylinder inlet port at the crankcase interface, the transfer port at the cylinder interface and crankcase are displayed. If the engine has a reedvalve a further graph showing the reed petal tip lift (divided by 10) is also displayed.

Selecting the exhaust side the pressure traces for the exhaust port at the cylinder interface, the transfer port at the cylinder interface and the cylinder pressure is shown. Because the cylinder pressure is much higher and will dominate the display the graph is limited to a pressure ratio of 3.

[After choosing the graphics options a summary of the port timing and the effective ]{lang="EN-UK" style="font-size:12.0pt"} [port]{style="font-size:12.0pt"}[ areas are displayed. The next figure shows this output.]{lang="EN-UK" style="font-size:12.0pt"}

 A typical output after the required number of iterations is shown in the next figure:

A list of some performance values are displayed at the top of the screen. To continue to the final screen press \"Enter\". The final screen shows a more complete summary of the performance values as shown in the next figure:

The meaning of the variables are explained in [TextOutput.htm](TextOutput.htm)

Clicking on \"**OK**\" will exit the program.
