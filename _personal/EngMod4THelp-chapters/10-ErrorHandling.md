## **[Error Handling in EngMod4T]{.underline}**

Sometimes there will be an error during the runtime of **EngMod4T**. This error can be one of three different cases:

1.  An error with a message to inform the user what is wrong with an explanation on what to fix,
2.  An error with a message that the program will stop requesting the user to pack the project and to email it to the developer,
3.  The program just halts and either freezes or exits with no message, or gives an erroneous result.

It is important and very much appreciated if you report these errors as it helps to make the software more robust and user friendly.

### Error with Explanation

This is usually some incompatibility with the geometry and the user is directed to use Dat4T to repair the issue. If you are unable to repair the issue you are still free to create a pack file and email it to the developer with a brief explanation or a screen shot of the error message.

### Error with Request

This type of error will usually have a message stating that \"a numerical error has occurred\" and the user is requested to send a pack file to the developer. The creation of a pack file is described in the Help files of Dat4T.

### EngMod4T freezes or exits with no explanation or cannot find or open a File or gives Erroneous Result

This is the most rare of the errors and requires special treatment. Please follow the following three steps:

1.  If the program does not automatically closes, stop the program using \"Task Manager\" which can be accessed by right clicking on the task bar,
2.  Send an error log file of the run to the developer. If you are using the default folders it will be in the ProjectName folder: **\"C:\\4Stroke\\ProjectName\\ProjectName.dat\"**
3.  If the program crashes before this file was created, send a log file of the startup to the developer. If you are using the default folders it will be in the Project folder: **\"C:\\4Stroke\\EngMod4TLicenseCheck.dat\"**
4.  Finally also create a pack file of the project and email it to the developer.

**Note:** The error log file gets overwritten every time EngMod4T is run so do these actions immediately after the error occured.
