## [Turbocharger Output (\*.tub)]{.underline}

The turbocharger files are part of the new or over written files. They have the project name appended with the rpm value and the extension **.tub**. The turbocharger traces for project Honda at 8000 rpm will be in the file: **Honda8000.tub**. This file will be in the project directory (folder) and over written each time a simulation at its specific rpm is conducted.

It has the following traces as output:

- **Deg**              Engine degrees using the last cylinder as reference.
- **TurboRPM**  Turbocharger rotor RPM.
- **ComprPr**       Pressure ratio across the compressor.
- **CompEff**        Compressor efficiency.
- **TurbPr**           Pressure ratio across the turbine.
- **WastePr**        Pressure ratio across the waste gate.
- **TurCenP**       Pressure in center of turbine - used for model debugging.
- **TurCenT**       Temperature in center of turbine - used for model debugging.
- **ComprDM**    Compressor mass flow.
- **TurStaDM**    Turbine mass flow.
- **TurMapDM**  Turbine mass flow.
- **TurRotDM**    Turbine mass flow.
- **WasteDM**     Waste gate mass flow.
- **CompPow**      Power absorbed by the compressor.
- **TurbPow**        Power generated by the turbine.

The turbocharger traces are still being developed and include some that is being used to develop and refine the turbocharger model. They might be deleted from future releases.
