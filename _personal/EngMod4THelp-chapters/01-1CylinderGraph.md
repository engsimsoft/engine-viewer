## [Single Cylinder Graphics]{.underline}

The first choice is whether to display the graphs on the intake side or exhaust side of the engine.

Selecting the intake side the pressure traces for the final cylinder inlet port at the crankcase interface, the transfer port at the cylinder interface and crankcase are displayed. If the engine has a reedvalve a further graph showing the reed petal tip lift (divided by 10) is also displayed.

Selecting the exhaust side the pressure traces for the exhaust port at the cylinder interface, the transfer port at the cylinder interface and the cylinder pressure is shown. Because the cylinder pressure is much higher and will dominate the display the graph is limited to a pressure ratio of 3.

[For a single cylinder engine this is the only option while on multi cylinder engines more options are displayed. After choosing the graphics options a summary of the port timing and the effective ]{lang="EN-UK" style="font-size:12.0pt"} [port]{style="font-size:12.0pt"}[ areas are displayed.

A list of some performance values are displayed at the top of the screen. To continue to the final screen press \"Enter\". The final screen shows a more complete summary of the performance values as shown in the next figure:
