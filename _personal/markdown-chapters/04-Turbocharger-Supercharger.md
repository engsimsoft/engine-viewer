## Turbocharger Modeling

**NOTE: This is the fifth release of the turbocharger module and a number of options discussed here are not yet available but under development.**

A turbocharger is modeled by importing a compressor map and a turbine swallowing curve. Once this is done the rest of the turbocharger characteristics are added. To select a turbocharged engine the following radio button is selected on the main engine dialog:

After saving the engine subsystem the turbocharger dialog will open:

### Number of Turbochargers {#number-of-turbochargers align="left"}

The user can select between one and two turbochargers.

### Multi Turbo Configuration {#multi-turbo-configuration align="left"}

If two turbochargers were selected the user has the choice between two parallel turbos (typically one per bank on a Vee or Flat engine) or two sequential turbos where one is the low pressure stage (LP) and one is the high pressure stage (HP), typically this is used on a highly boosted 3 or 4 cylinder engine. For the first case the two parallel turbos use the same compressor map and turbine swallowing curve, while for the sequential case each turbo has its own compressor map and turbine swallowing curve.

### Wastegate {#wastegate align="left"}

The user select whether a wastegate is fitted or not. There are two options if a wastegate is fitted:

If a single boost value is selected the user has to supply the following data:

If a boost map is selected the user has to supply the following data:

![](../Pictures/TurboWasteGateCurveData.jpg){border="0"}

Using the button \"**Draw BoostCurve**\" the boost curve is displayed:

### Boost Measurement Point {#boost-measurement-point align="left"}

The user has to select where the boost pressure and boost temperature will be measured. This is the point where the pressure will be measured for wastegate or other boost control as well as the value that goes into the results files.

### Boost Control on Compressor Side {#boost-control-on-compressor-side align="left"}

The boost pressure can also be controlled on the compressor side by using a \"blow off valve\" or \"bypass control\". Blow off is inefficient as pressure is just bleat to atmosphere. Bypass control is also used to control boost but is used to prevent compressor surge during sudden shutting of the throttle.

### Moment of Inertia (MoI) {#moment-of-inertia-moi align="left"}

The turbo does not operate at a constant speed but accelerates and decelerates continuously during operation. To capture these dynamics correctly the moment of inertia must be supplied. The user can choose to supply the MoI of each of the 3 main  components separately or combined. This is a very difficult value to obtain so a calculator has been added that calculates a first order approximation from the compressor and turbine dimensions that has been entered.

### Turbine Entry Type {#turbine-entry-type align="left"}

There are three options available for the turbine entry:

### Turbine Inlet Guide Vanes {#turbine-inlet-guide-vanes align="left"}

There are three options available for guide vanes in the impellor inlet, no guide vanes, fixed guide vanes and moveable guide vanes, also known as variable geometry turbine (VGT). If the VGT option is selected the turbine characteristic must be a family of swallowing curves with each curve the value for a different vane angle.

### Back Pressure Measurement Position

There are three back pressure measurement positions available to choose from:

- **Turbine Entry** This is the default position and the generally accepted option.
- **Exhaust Port** This option will show the highest value and is the actual value that influences the engine performance but not easy to measure in practice.
- **Collector** This option is often chosen in practice because of accessibility reasons. It will give a back pressure value slightly higher than the turbine entrace value.

### Compressor Map and Characteristics

The compressor map and characteristics are generated by the **DigiComp** software which generates a file with the impeller dimensions and flow characteristics in a format required by the simulation software. To import a compressor map the button \"**Select Compressor File**\" is clicked which opens a typical file open dialog where the relevant file is selected:

![](../Pictures/TurboSelectComp.jpg){border="0" <="" p=""}

After selecting the file the dialog is updated by displaying the file name and the relevent impeller dimensional data:

![](../Pictures/TurboCompSelected.jpg){border="0"}

### Turbine Map and Characteristics

The turbine map and characteristics are generated by the **DigiTurb** software which generates a file with the turbine dimensions and flow characteristics in a format required by the simulation software. To import a turbine map the button \"**Select Turbine File**\" is clicked which opens a typical file open dialog where the relevant file is selected:

![](../Pictures/TurboSelectTurb.jpg){border="0"}

After selecting the file the dialog is updated by displaying the file name and the relevent turbine dimensional data:

![](../Pictures/TurboTurbSelected.jpg){border="0"}

After selecting both the compressor and turbine we can now test the first order matching of the compressor and turbine to the engine. This matching is done at the maximum power rpm value as specified on the engine dialog. To test the compressor matching click on the **\"Plot\"** button next to the compressor file name:

![](../Pictures/TurboCompMatch.jpg){border="0"}

The red dot on the compressor map is the area where the compressor will operate under the current assumptions of volumetric efficiency and heat release rates. This is internal to the software and cannot be changed by the user. In this case we see it is very close to the surge line indicating that this compressor is probably too big for this engine.

Next we test the matching of the turbine by clicking on the **\"Plot\"** button next to the turbine file name:

![](../Pictures/TurboTurbMatch.jpg){border="0"}

The red dot on the swallowing curve is the probable area where the turbine will operate. The green dot is the full engine mass flow and the difference will flow through the wastegate.

The final bit of data required is the moment of inertia of the rotor. As this is very seldom available a utility is included in the software that estimates it from the compressor wheel diameter. Clicking on the **\"Estimate MoI\"** button the following is displayed:

The **\"Save and Exit\"** button can now be clicked.

## Supercharger Modeling

**NOTE: This is the third release of the supercharger module and a number of options discussed here are not yet available but under development.**

A supercharger is modeled by importing a compressor map. This map can be for a Centrifugal or a Twin Screw (Twin Lobe or Roots) blower. Once this is done the rest of the supercharger characteristics are added. To select a supercharged engine the following radio button is selected on the **main engine dialog**:

![](../Pictures/TurboEngineMenuSuper.jpg){border="0"}

**NOTE:** After changing a naturally aspirated engine to a Supercharged engine on the main engine dialog you have to first create the new Supercharger subsystem and then create the new Inlet subsystem that connects to the new Supercharger.

After saving the engine subsystem the supercharger dialog will open:

### Blower Type or Compressor Type

Two types can be modeled, a Centrifugal compressor and a Twin Screw compressor (also known as a twin lobe or as a Roots compressor) and one must be selected from the following two radio buttons:

![](../Pictures/BlowerType.jpg){border="0"}

If \"Centrifugal\" is selected extra information about the compressor is displayed. Initially until a compressor map is selected the values will be zero:

![](../Pictures/CentrifugalDataZero.jpg){border="0"}

### Boost Control on Compressor Side

The boost pressure can be controlled on the compressor side by using a \"blow off valve\" or a \"bypass valve\" control. Blow off is inefficient as pressure is just bled to atmosphere. Bypass control is also used to control boost but feeds the blown of air back in line before the compressor and is used to prevent compressor surge during sudden shutting of the throttle.

![](../Pictures/SuperBoostControl.jpg){border="0"}

Selecting to control the boost opens extra input edit boxes and radio buttons:

![](../Pictures/TurboBoostControl_BoV.jpg){border="0"}

**NOTE: The bypass valve option is not yet available but under development.**

### Supercharger Drive Ratio

The supercharger is mechanically driven by the engine. Typically with a toothed belt and pulley system. The ratio between the drive pulley and the driven pulley is the \"external\" ratio. Some superchargers (mostly the centrifugal type) has an internal gearbox to speed the input up even further. The ratio of this internal gearbox is the \"internal\" ratio. If there is no internal ratio this value is entered as \"1\".

![](../Pictures/SuperDriveRatio.jpg){border="0"}

There is also a \"Calc\" button to calculate the ratio to be used. Clicking on the \"Calc\" button opens a sub dialog:

![](../Pictures/SuperDriveRatioCalc.jpg){border="0"}

### Compressor Map and Characteristics

The compressor map and characteristics are generated by the **DigiComp** software which generates a file with the impeller dimensions and flow characteristics in a format required by the simulation software. To import a compressor map the button \"**Select Compressor File**\" is clicked which opens a typical file open dialog where the relevant file is selected:

![](../Pictures/SuperSelectComp.jpg){border="0"}

After selecting the file the dialog is updated by displaying the file name:

![](../Pictures/SuperCompSelected.jpg){border="0"}

Selecting the **Plot**-button displays the map and the initial estimated match point. The next pictures show the typical input data and map for a centrifugal compressor followed by a Roots type example.\
Note that although the supercharger rpm of the match point as displayed on the map is correct the pressure ratio of the match point is as prescribed by the system blow off pressure or by-pass pressure this is no guarantee that the engine breathing / flow resistance characteristics will actually match this point. To determine the actual point a simulation must be conducted.
